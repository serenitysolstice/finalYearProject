The annual distribution of the prizes and car- tificates obtained by the pupils of the Denbigh Grammar School at the May Examinations of the Department of Science and Art South Kensington, took plrce in the schoolroom on Thursday last. The prizes were distributed by Dr. Tumour, chair- man of the local committee and of the governing body of the school. There were also present, the Mayor (R. Humphreys Roberts, Esq.). Messrs. John Roberts (secretary), D. Griffith (N P. Bank), and T. Benson Evans, members of the local committee. The Head-Master stated that this was the seventh year in which the pupils cf the school had been presented at these examinations. The number of certificates obtainted this year was 37. including three first classes, a decrease of 13 certificates as compared with last year's results. This falling off in the number of successes, he attributed mainly to the mterference of the Easter holiday with the work of preparation, Easter having this year been unusually late. The total number of certificates won during the seven years the classes had been in operation was 251, including 34 first classes and Queen's prizes. The Chairman, while congratulating the prize winners on their successes, encouraged the unsuc- cessful students to renewed effort. He exhorted them to make the best use of their present ad- vantages, and reminded them that now nearly all the chief appointments in the state were thrown .pen to public competition. The Mayor spoke of the advanced state of education in Germany, and of the great eagerness evinced by all classes in that country in pursuit of learning. There was no need of truant-officers in that country. The Head-Master, on behalf of himself and the boys, thanked the Chairman, the Mayor, and other members of the local committee for their presence at the distribution, and their kindly help in superintending the examinations. The pupils present, to the number of fifty, were then regaled with a substantial tea. The rest of the evening was spent in singing, recitations, and other amusements.

He entered the School at the age of 12. in Sep- tember, 1896, with a Free Entrance Scholar- ship from the Central Higher Grade School. In 1898 he obtained 1st Class Honours in the Junior Local Examination of the University of Oxford, with distinction in French. It should be explained that the Gold Medal i3 offered annually by the Chief Inspector to the best candidate from all the Intermediate Schools of Wales. It was given last year for the first time, and went then to Percy Wykes, of Wrexham School, who, in the same year. carried off the first Mathematical Scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford. Mr. T. A. Goskar, of Ffynone-street, Swan- sea, has obtained a Whitworth Exhibition tenable for one year. value \u00a350. He has at- tended the Technical School, and has also been attending Mr. Hosford's Science and Art Classes. He occupies the position of draughtsman at the Graigola Fuel Works, and is to be congratulated on his success. It is nearly four or five years since a similar exhibition was awarded in Swansea to Mr. Evan Stephen, a cousin of Mr. T. A. Goskar.",

James, 3, Gilgal Terrace, Pennar, Pembroke Dock ,writes to inform us as follows I beg to inform you that the lists of the subjects in which I obtained a Central Welsh Board Senior Certificate was incomplete as published in your paper last week. You omitt- ed to say that I passed in Latin (with distinc- tion), and in Mathematics (with distinction). I should be obliged if you will correct this error in your next issue. Perhaps it would be con- venient if I give a correct list of the subjects in which I obtained a certificate:\u2014Composition, English Language (with distinction), English History (with distinction), English Literature, French (with distinction and conversational power), Latin (with distinction), Arithmetic (with distinction), Mathematics (with distinc- tion), Chemistry.\"",

THE OOUNTY SCHOOL. The County School re-opened on the 20th inst. The new pupils number about 30. There are now 80 pupils on the register.

The new work-room for manual instruction has been well-equipped, and the tools, etc., have been very orderly arranged.

Hawkins. '.Latin' Haydn Phillips (History) and Gwilym L. Wil. liams (Chemistry). Such a list of successes at a London Matricu- lation Examination speaks for itself and will, we feel sure, be received with much pleasure and gratification by the people of Merthyr as some- thing affording further evidence of good work done at their Cyfarthfa Secondary School.",

The distribution of the prizes and certifcates obtained by the pupils of the Denbigh Grammar Sdiooi. :it I I;e May examinations of the Govern- ment Department of Science and Art, took place m the Schoolroom, on Thursday last. In the unavoidable abtence of the Chairman of the local committee (Dr. Tumour), the chair was taken and the prizes distributed by the Rev. J. Morgan, rector ot Denbigh. The Head Master stated that this was the sixth year in which the pupils of the School had been presented at these Examinations. In the first year, 1880, only four certificates were obtained, while in the present year just 50 certi- ficates, including five first classes, and one Queen's Prize had been won. \u00ab This was five certificates more than last year, and two more than in any preceding year. This indicated a steady progress, notwithstanding the increasing.stringency of the examinations. The total number of certificates obtained daring the six years was 21-1, including 31 first classc-s. The chairman congratulated the boys and their Head and Assistant Masters on the very satis- factory results of the examination, and on the high reputation which the school had acquired for the success of its pupils at t'.is and the Cam- bridg\" Local and other public examination. lie trusted that, the unsuccessful students would not be disheartened by their failure, but that they won d be stimulated by this day's proceedings to increased application, and to a determination to cairy off something next time, Mr. J. Roberts, the St crctary likewise addressed a few encourag- ing remarks to the boys. After the distribution a nib.-tau;ial tea was provided for the pupils presen', numbering over sixty. The rest of the evening was spent very pleasantly in singing, recitation, aud other amusements. 1 lie following is the list of t-, ozze -i-.I o obtained certificates and prizts:\u2014F. W.

The number of first classes (22) is, we believe, the largest obtained by any Welsh public grammar school in this year's examination. A. E. Davies and W. S. Jenkius have respectively the largest number of first classes among Welsh candidates, and are bracketed third in that respect out of all candidates in the United Kingdom. The average age of the candidates presented from Carmarthen was under sixteen years. APPOINTMENT OF MATHEMATICAL MASTER. Mr A. S. Henwood, B A., of Trinity College, Cambridge, has been appointed to the mathematiclr mastership at the above school as successor to M E. H. Ilensley, M.A late scholar of St. John's College, Cambridge.

Caronian Evans (chairman), David Jones (vice-chairman), Joseph Edwards (mason), Timothy Evans (Deriodyn), and David Thomas (clerk).-The minutes of the pre- vious meeting were read and confirmed.\u2014The Chairman said there was only one list of irregular attendants, being that from Castell Flemish Board School. It contained the name of one offender only. It was intimated that the boy in question resided out of the district over which the Board had direct control, and the Clerk had instructions to communicate with the Lledrod and Blaenpenal United District School Board with reference to the case, urging that Board, in whose district the boy resides, to compel the guardian of the child to send him to school regularly in future. It was further reported that a child from Castell Flemish School had been recently removed to London whose education had not been properly attended to. A similar case having been previously reported from the same school, the Clerk was directed to make an effort to ascertain the present addresses of the two children and to call the attention of the London School Board to their cases.\u2014The Clerk was instructed to invite tenders for the supply of coal to the various schools during the coming winter. \u2014Cheques were signed for bills. WAR NEWS.\u2014Miss Kate Driscoll has received a letter from her brother, Private Dan Driscoll. The following extract will be read with interest:- Bronkhorstspruit, August 17. 1900. My dear Kate,\u2014We heard a couple of days ago that De Wet had died, but I won't believe it until I see it officially confirmed. We have witnessed some novel scenes these last few days. While at Estre Fabricken we saw the fighting Boers' women and children going to join their husbands and fathers at the front. This morning I went down to the station to see them. They were in low trucks, old and young, women and children. Each one was carrying a flag or banner. All the banners had inscriptions on, such as God bless our burghers,' &c. There were a lot of fellows at the station, and as the train stopped there an hour we had a good look at them (the Boer women and children) and had a long talk with some of them. Some of them were sulky, some cheeky, others were full of life and fun. Some of the women were glad to go and join their husbands, others did not want to go. One young woman told us the only thing she was sorry for was that she had left a sweetheart behind. Many told us they were going to take the field and fight with their husbands and that we would not be much longer in the Transvaal, as they were going to drive us out of it. When the train was steaming out they nearly all put up their extended hands with the thumbs to their noses. Some even put up their two hands, all the while shouting as loud as they could. I suppose it is Bob's doing sending them out. This particular lot was from Johannesberg and there were 522 of them. We shall see some more to-morrow, when there are 1,800 to go up. I have just heard that De Wet is not captured, but he is still surrounded, as usual. I managed to get another 'tickey' (a threepenny-piece) and am going to enclose it in this letter. I hope it will be safe and not detected. I managed to buy some envelopes this morning.\u2014Your affectionate brother, DA.x.\" COUNTY SCHOOL.\u2014The results of the recent Central Board examination of this school have arrived and show that during the past year really phenomenal progress has been made in all departments of work. Ten senior certificates have been gained, none with less than two dis- tinctions and one with five. Thirteen junior certificates must be added to these, most of which bear distinctions also, one pupil, Owen Morgan, carrying away a total of six. There are twenty-six distinctions in the senior stage and nineteen in the junior, making forty-five in all. The distinctions run through the whole curriculum without exception, indicating highly- efficient teaching and much steady work on the part of the pupils. On three of the senior cer- tificates sufficient subjects are endorsed to satisfy the requirements of the matriculation examination of the University of Wales. This makes the school matriculation record for the year, two passes in London University and six complete passes in the Welsh University, a con- siderable advance on last year. The following is the complete list :\u2014Senior certificate Hubert Davies, composition, English language, history, arithmetic, mathematics, Welsh, distinction in English and Welsh Sarah Anne Davies, com- position, English language, history, arithmetic, mathematics, French, mechanics, distinction in English and mechanics Thomas Hughes Davies, composition, English language, history, arithmetic, mathematics, Latin, elementary science, mechanics, and chemistry (honour stage), distinction in history, arithmetic, mathe- matics, Latin, and mechanics William David Davies, composition, English, History, arith- metic, mathematics, Welsh, distinction in Welsh and English David James Edwards, composi- tion, English history, arithmetic, mathematics, Latin, mechanics, and chemistry (honour stage), distinction in English, mathematics, and mechanics Jane Mary Jones, composition, English, arithmetic, mathematics, Welsh, French, distinction in mathematics and Welsh Joseph Jones, composition, English history, arithmetics, mathematics, Welsh, chemistry, distinction in English, arithmetic, and Welsh David Jenkins Morgan, composition, English, history, arithmetic, mathematics, Latin, Welsh, chemistry, distinction in arithmetic and Welsh Thomas Morgans, composition, English, arith- metic, mathematics, Latin, Welsh, chemistry, distinction in arithmetic and Welsh Thomas Herbert Richards, composition, English, arith- metic, mathematics, Latin, Welsh, distinction in arithmetic, mathematics, and Welsh.

Scholastic.\u2014We are pleased to record the recent success of Mr. Jacob Meurig Jones, Brogynin, who has taken a scholarship of \u00a3 20 for mathematics at Aberystwyth College. He was educated at the County School, which he entered from Trefeirig School, where his ele- mentary training was obtained under the head- mastership of Mr. D. Hamer. He obtained an open scholarship as entrance at the County School, and his career Has been very brilliant from the beginning. In 1900 he passed the Board of Education's (science and art) exam- ination in mathematics first stage, taking a first class. Then came the junior certificate of the Central Welsh Board, passing in nine subjects, with two distinctions. In June, 1901, he was successful in passing the Welsh matriculation, the examinations of the Board of Education in theoretical mechanics of sol- ids, an din inorganic chemistry, first class. In the same year he also passed the senior cer- tificate of the Central Welsh Board, passing in nine subjects. In 1902 he passed the ex- aminations of the Board of Education in mechanics, and in mathematics second stage. This year he passed the same Board's exam- ination in mathematics, third stage in the first class, and also the fifth stage, including high subjects such as analytical geometry and differential calculus, and integral calcu- lus. In addition, he has also taken the hon- ours certificate of the Central Welsh Board in addition to mathematics, together with the calculus, and also mechanics, which he passed with distinction, and elementary science of the senior certificate stage.

GIUMMATI SCIIOIIL.-The results of the exa- minations held simultaneously by the Examining Boards of the Universities of Oxford and Cam- bridge, in the Public Schools of England and Wales, have been published within the last few days. It may not be generally known that the standard necessary to qualify for certificates is somewhat higher than that of Responsions at Oxford and the Previous Examinations at Cam- bi idge; and that these certificates are not only valuable to those who enter the Universities, but are accepted also by the Examining Boards of tho Legal and Medical Professions as more than equi- valent to the requirements of the preliminary examinations. The whole of the highest form at this school, consisting of six boys, competed for the cartific iteb; the very favourable reports of the examiners have already appeared in our columns, and wo are pleased to find that those reports have been fully borne out by the recent awards as givelJ below \"Certificates. J. Humphreys passed in Latin, Greek, Elementary Mathematics, Scripture Knowledge and History. J. R. Roberts passed iu Latin, Greek, Elementary Mathematics, Scripture Knowledge and History, and obtained distinction in Greek. W. Liftou Wynne passed in Latin, Greek, Elementary Mathematics, Scripture Knowledge and History. W. Wynne passed in Latiu, Elementary and Advanced Mathematics, and Scripture Know- ledge. W. A.

                "full_text": "1% PORTH COUNTY SCHOOL Annual Distribution of Prizes. I The ini) distribution of prizes and certificates to the students of the Porth I Oourty S- hpl for Boys took place at Bethlehem (C.M.) Chapel, Porth, on Thursday, the 17th inst. Mr. Tom John, M.A., J.P., took the place of Dr. W. E. Thomas, J.P., Ystrad, as chairman, the latter sending an apology to the Governors for his inability to attend the meeting. The meeting was opened by the singing of Hen Wiad fy Nhadau by a scholar of the school. The Chairman, in His address, said that education was the apprenticeship of life. At the present time we were in conflict with a natien which had given education the foremost position for many years, and yet it was a remarkable fact that the initiative, the ingenuity and self-reliant type of the Tommies at the front showed that, however advanced the Germans might be in the matter of education, the system ard form of education given in this country produced men able to be self- reliant citizens. Mr. John compared the advantages of education in the present day with that of 60 and 70 years ago, when any boy who might have enthusiasm for edu- cation had the greatest possible difficulty in getting up the educational ladder. The Junior Boys then gave renderings of the Belgian and Russian National Anthems, under the conductorship of Mr. T. Price, M.I.S.M. A recitation, entitled \"The Battle of the Bight,\" was given by Richard W. Jones (Form IV,), followed by the nong, composed from the same words by Mr. T. Price, by the Junior Boys. Report of the Headmaster. I Mr. Evan Samuel, B.A., headmaster, in his report, said:In September, 1913, the new girls' school was opened, and the boys have consequently been taught apart since that time. In the corresponding term of last year we had 173 boys on t,he roll; now we have 192. No doubt the number will reach its full complement next year. The number of boys to be educated at the school by scheme is 200, although we have comfort- able accommodation for 250. There was no extension of the work during laet year. The school, I believe, now meets the needs of the district very well. A farther extension of the commer- cial work would be an advantage, as a great proportion of our boys enter a busi- ness life of some kind or other. The triennial inspection took place in May last, when Mr. O. Owen, Mr. Robin- son, ard Mr. Lengsdon spent two days at the school tearing lessons being given and seeing the work of the school. Their report has rome to hand, and I would read it to you word for word if there had been time. The Governors have expressed satisfaction with the report. The C.W.B. examination results have been, if anything, better than in any past year. There were fewer failures. At the Junior Certificate examination, 22 out of 24 passed; at the Senior Certificate exami- nation, 16 out of 18 passed. We had three successes &t the Higher Certificate, and three at the Honours Certificate. Of the three who took the Honours Certificate, two obtained Glamorgan County Scholar- ships of the value of about 945 per annum. We had two who passed the London Matri- culation Examination one boy clerkship at the Civil Service; and successes at other minor examinations like the Post Office aDd Bank Clerks' examinations. 11 The occupations of pupils who left during the year ending July 31st, 1914, are as follow:\u2014At Universities, 3 (one a medieai student); teaching as proba- tioner assistants in elementary schools, 6; pupil teachers, 3; in banks, 4; appren- ticed to engineering, 4 Civil Service and other bediee, 4 clerks, 6 chemist s assis- tant, 1; dental mechanic, 1 Guy's Hos- pital (dental), 1: shop assistants, 3; other school, 6: mining student at, colliery, 1; laboratory assistant at mining school, 1; not known, 7. PHYSICAL WELFARE. I \"We have a playing field in a very healthy and pleasant position just behind the school. Roys make full use of this for games. If it were properly drained it would make an excellent field. The boys play matches with similar schools on Satur- days, and are always accompanied by a master. They visited last veair Merthyr, Penparo, Barry, Pontypridd, CardiffAc. \"Drill is also thoroughly done in the gymnasium, both by Sergt.-Major Ward and some cf the staff, who supplement the work done by the County Drill Instructor. \"The report of the Inspector of the County Ccuncil states In Form IV. the trunk bending exercises and the marching, and the work on the ladder deserve special mention. In Forms V. and VI. the lunging, rcpe climbing, and all the vault- ing was very good. STAFF. I \"Last April, Mr. A. S. Hodgson left j ns to become the headmaster of Pentre I Secondare School. Mr. W. Jones suc- j ceeded him as senior master, and Mr. Evans became chief physics master. Mr. Redfearn, M.Sc. (Manchester), will join the staff nexit term. For the good work that has been done during the past year I have to tha.nk the members of the staff. I believe all my colleagues are permeated with a sense of the private duties of their position and of the trust reposed in them. To them, of course, is due in a very great degree the success of the work of the school.\" Mr. T. J. Hughes, the chairman of the Welsh Insurance Commissioners, before proceeding to award the prizes, said the present occasion might be considered as his official birthday, as it was just three years since that the position he now held was offered him by the Prime Minister. Education, he said, was not simply to ram into the brain isolated facts of dates, length of rivers, and such like, but to raise the ideas and to put a weapon into the hands of the young people for use at a later day. He regretted to find from the report that there was such a small proportion of boys of over the ages of 16 or 17, and considered that parents should do their utmost to keep their boys at school until they had acquired an educa- tion that would fit them for any walk in life, and instanced the\" possibilities of the Civil Service. Early this year, he said, the Commissitmers had, in the interests of Welsh secondary education, approached the Treasury and the Civil Service Com- mission, with the result that a special com- petitive examination was sanctioned and held for assistant clerks in the Insurance Commission offices. The age-limits-17-18 \u2014and the syllabus had been specially designed so as -to attract youths leaving the county schools. The Welsh Appoint- ments Board had brought particulars of the examination to the notice of the county school authorities throughout the Principality. What had been the result? There were 30 vacancies, but only 26 can- didates presented themselves. Eighteen bad obtained the qualifying number of marks, and of these thirteen came from Welsh county schools. A baker's doaen out of several hundred pupils who might have cor apet I I There would doubtless be some vacancies-be could not say how many\u2014next year. It was by no means certain that the Commissioners could in- duce the Treasury and the Civil Service Commission to repeat the experiment, but, if they did, he trusted the results would be far different. The initial experiment had proved to be far from encouraging. The post of assistant clerk was practically the first rung of the Civil Service ladder, and. although the commencing salary was low, there were increasing increments up to 9160 per annum, and, of course, infinite possibilities of promotion and advance- ment in cases of, exceptional ability and merit. He hoped the Welsh county school authorities would take the matter into serious consideration and make it im- possible for a repetition of this year's fiasco. Mr. Hughes referred to the practice in Welsh homes of keeping the front room as an almost sacred place which the chil- dren feared to enter. The front room, he said, should be at the disposal of the chil- dren. They should be encouraged to use it. and entertain their friends as much as they liked there. A new carpet for the floor was easier obtainable than a new character for a. boy. By making the home attractive, it safeguarded the children from the attractions of the streets. List of Awards.

                "full_text": "Porth Boys' County School. Annual Distribution of Prizes and Certificates. The prizes and certificates awarded to the pupils of Porth Boys' County School Oil the examination results for 1915, \u00bb'ere dis- tributed un Tuesday evening last, at Tabernacle kE.B.) Chapel, Porth, by the Right Hon. William Abraham (Mabon), M.P. After the singing of the hymn, \u2022'O Arglwydd Dduw,\" by the School Choir, the chairman, Dr. \\V. E. Thomas, M.D., J.P., addressed the meetiing, pointing out in a few well chosen words, that Mabon, in attending the meeting, was making what was almost his first public appearance after his long and serious illness. He pointed out the great honour which Mr. Abraham had attained in becoming a member of the Privy Council, and thoug.il that a portion of the honour was reflected on the School. The song Pimpinella (Tchaikowsky), was then rendered by the School Choir of junior boys, in excellent style, after which the headmaster, Mr. E. Samuel, M.A., proceeded to deliver his report of the school work for the preceding year. in the course oi his speech Mr. Samuel dwelt upon the excellent work of the staff, and the magnificent examination results ob- tained, the upper portion of the school especially, having done exceedingly well. Two boys, Ivor A. Williams and William Hellings, had obtained County Scholar- ships of the value ot t45 per annum, for three or four years, and the former boy had received notification from the authorities of Jesus College, Oxford, that he was within a few marks of the boy who had won a scholarship at that college, of the value of JE:80 per annum for four years. With regard to the Staff there had been two changes. Mr. Redlearn, M.Sc., had joined the staff in January, and Mr. Lewis, B.A., had left at the end of July to join the Army for the period of the war. His place had been filled, temporarily, by Mr. Williams. Mr, Samuel was pleased to state that all members of the staff of military age had enlisted under Lord Derby's scheme, to come up for mititary service when called upon. Mr. Samuel then proceeded to contrast the British educational system and the German, and to show the terrible effects of militarism as taught in German elemen- tary schools. He pointed out that under our system a boy has a general education until he reaches the age of 16, and then specialises for two years before leaving the secondary school. In Germany the pupil specialises from a very early age, chiefly in modern languages, but in almost evecy ease better results are obtained under the British system. This speech, delivered in Mr. Samuel's usual capable fashion, was greeted with great applause. It was followed by an ex- cellent violin solo Le Reve, executed by Albert E. (Teddy) Smith in a very creditable manner. Mr. \\vTliiam Abraham then proceeded to distribute the cenifieatesand prizes, after delivering a short speech. He bad a message for both the staff and the boys, asking neither to be satisfied with their previous work, but to g(, oii, and climb higher and higher. They boys, he said, were being helped on now hy external aid perhaps, but after reaching a certain stage it would be by their own powers alone that they could climb. They were now being given the opportunity to conserve and build up their powers for the final unaided efforts. In a very humorous manner Mabon appealed to those present to forgive his use of notes for reference during his speech; it v.;ls embarassing to him, he said, to use them, but it was absolutely necessary. The distribution of the prizes was fol- lowed by the rendering of a Scout Song,\" by a party of junior boys dressed in the picturesque scout uniform, the chorus being sung by the School Choir. This was followed by the recitation of The Newsboy's Debt,\" a pathetic piece delievered in a style that commanded per- fect silence, and brought a tear to more than one eye. A perfect roar of applause broke out, and continued until Clifford Roberts, the juvenile elociftionist, re- turned. He then recited a humorous piece, Boys' Rights,\" which was so de- livered that frequently Clifford could not be heard by reason of the roars uf laughter he occasioned. There is no doubt that the boy will become one of our premier elocu- tionists when he grows up. He was again applauded for some time, but the chair- man was forced, on account of time, to proceed with the programme. The thanks of the assembly, proposed by Mrs. Mary Griffiths, Maes Gwyn, Cymmer, and seconded by Mrs. Florence Nicholas, the Garth, Trealaw, were unanimously signified to Mr. Abraham for the way in which he had performed his share in the ceremony. Mabon acknowledged the thanks in a neat speech, and thanked those present for the way in they had greeted him. Unfortunately, he was un- able to remain-during the rest of the pro- gramme, owing to important business. The next item was the singing of the Welsh Airs, \"Llwyn Onn and Rhyfel- gyreh Cadben Morgan,\" by the School Choir. This was followed by a vote of thanks to the chairman, proposed by Alderman Morgan Williams, J.P., and seconded by Councillor Mark Harcomur. The very successful meeting was bruoght to a close by the singing of the Welsh and English National Anthems, the former being sung by Alun Davies, Form V. Great praise is due to Mr. David Jones, M.I.S.M., for the excellent singing of the School Choir, trained by him. PRIZES AWARDED BY SIR WILLIAM JAMES THOMAS, YNYSHIR.

There were an enormous number of people teaching in this country who did not know how to do it, and as long as that was the case there was a great deal to be done. What was want- ed was for someone to speak with authority as regarded his own experience from the ex- perience he had tried, and, if lie mistook not, before many years were over there would be somebody from the County School in Hawar- den who would be able to tell to the country what it was sorely in need of learning, and which would tend to lift the whole tone of education from one end of England to the other (applause).

The results of the examinations held last sum- mer term are now all to hand, and Abergele County School is once again credited with a large number of successes. At the Matriculation Examination of the Univer- sity of Wales, Olwen Jones (Colwyn Bay), and Nellie Thomas passed in the First Division David Edward Lawrence in the Second Divis- ion Dorothy Coley (Colwyn Bay) in four sub- jects, and Myrddin Evans passed in the remaining subject necessary to complete his examination. At the Central Welsh Board examinations twenty distinctions were obtained at the various stages. In the Honours Certificate examination Edward Arthur Hughes (who earlier in the year gained an Open Scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge) was placed third on the list for all Wales, and was awarded a Denbighshire County Exhibition of \u00a325 for four years. Another Aber- gele pupil, Goronwy Owen, Colwyn Bay, was placed 28th on the list for all Wales. During the summer term the school was visited by Mr Owen Owen, M.A., Chief Inspector of the Central Welsh Board Mr Robinson, the Assist- ant Inspector, and others for the purposes of the Triennial Inspection. The Chief Inspector's report on the work and organisation of the school was considered to be so satisfactory that the Governors at their last meeting unanimously passed a resolution compli- menting the staff for the excellence of its work. In the minor examinations several pupils of Abergele County School were placed high on the list of candidates for pupil teacherships, and were awarded scholarships of \u00a38 each, tenable at the school. Forty new pupils have entered the school this term, and the number at present in attendance is larger than it ever has been. There is, there- fore, every prospect of still more successful results for Abergele County School in the near future. The following is the full list of certificate win- ners at Central Welsh Board examinations. As these certificates qualify for teacherships in ele- mentary schools and exempt candidates from sitting at the various professional preliminary examinations, considerable commercial value is attached to them HONOURS CERTIFICATES.

                "full_text": "MORE SCHOLARSHIPS, but that meant more rates. They should have an educational grant for that purpose (hear, hear). He hoped that under Lord Haldane's scheme more money would be provided for educational purposes. He (Mr. Hughes) thought a great failing of secondary I schools was the parents did not leave their children there long enough. The tendency was for the children to leave the elementary school after sixth standard had been reach ed, and then the parents sent them to the se- condary school for twelve months or so to be \"finished off.\" They should keep them in the county school much longer than that, other- wise it was not fair to the children or the teachers. The education the children got in the secondary school would be of great bene- fit in life, and he appealed to them to make the most of their time whilst they were in school. If they did not take advantage of the facilities given them they would regret it in after days (applause). On the motion of the Rev. J. Burrows, Mr. Hughes was heartily thanked for distributing the prizes. Conducted by Mr. J. E. Parry, B.A., the scholars sang choral selections very sweetly. D WON BY PAST PUPILS.

                "full_text": "day School. He was a Freemason, being a member of the Sir Watkin (1477) Lodge. One of the founders of the Mold Cosmopo- litan Society, he took a prominent part in the work associated with it, and for a per- iod acted as secretary. He was of a genial and kindly disposition and of a gene- rous nature, and it was always a source of pleasure to him to be of service to others. He had a tremendous capacity for work, and was all accomplished orgniser. His skill as an organiser was particularly appa- rent on the occasion of what was known as the Ice Carnival Bazaar, which was the first serious effort made to raise funds for the restoration of the Parish Church. The bazaar was on a most elaborate scale, and Mr. Jones organised and worked it, so far as the secretarial duties were concerned, singlehanded. Afterwards tangible evi- dences were shown towards Mr. Jones of the high appreciation in which he was held by the Churchpeople of Mold. Another function at which he rendered invaluable assistance was the first Christmas dinner to the poor given under the auspices of the Mold Cosmopolitan Society. Mr. Jones was an ardent photographer, and was very skilled in the art. He was unmarried. His death is mourned by his father and three sisters (one of whom is the principal of the girls' department at the Rhyl County School) and other relatives, and by a wide circle of friends. The funeral took place at Mold Cemetery on Saturday. The Vicar (the Rev. Evan Jones) officiated, and the Rev. C. H. Dickens Lewis (Curate) was also present. In addition to the members of the deceased's family, there was a good at- \u2022 tendance of the general public, despite the inclemency of the weather. Among those present were Mr. Thos. Parry, J.P., Mr. T. H. Ollive, Messrs. Owen, Chas. Adams and W. O. Jones (representing the London and North-Western Railway Co.), Messrs. W. B, Rowdon and D. R. Thomas (past and present secretaries of the Church Council), and a number of Freemasons. At the close of the committal service sprigs of acacia were thrown upon the coffin by the Freemasons present. Many exquisite floral tributes were sent. ALUN COUNTY SCHOOL. CENTRAL WELSH BOARD EXAMI- NATION RESULTS.

                "full_text": "PORTMADOC COUNTY SCHOOL. PRIZE DAY. 1 The annual distribution of prizes in con nection with the Portmadoc County School took place, on Friday evening, at the Town Hall. Mr J. Jones Morris (chairman of the I Governing Body) presided, and he was supported on the platform by several of the I school Governors. The Chairman f\";iid the school he(1 had a remarkably successful year in every respect. The pupils had inci -ased from 70 to 101, and their scholastic achievements included six honours' certificate-* of the Central Welsh Board, five senior and seven junior certi- \u00a1 ficates, whilst three had passed the London matriculation, and, had gained a county exhibition, and two had gained exhibitions fit the Aberystwyth College. I. The Headmaster, Mr J. Rhy- Evans, A., in an address or the intermediate \u00a1 school system of said the hostile critics were non. a greatly-diminished race, One proph.L said the county schools would simp1;, turn out preachers and secondary [ p .tiool teachers. Never had a theory been bet3n so falsified, as far as Portmadoc was concerned. The real value of the inter- I' mediate school system could not be demon- strated in ten years; but it would be felt to the full by generations to come. What they were trying tb do now was to j'aise the intellectual standard. It was here that Germany was in advance of England. In no German secondary school v.as there more practical science than in the Welsh county school; but the different grades of! education regarded generally were more i'dapted to training in science; and the bringing of these three grades of education in this country into a consciousness of a common and great aim must be in the fore- front of the futur\" programme of education idealists (applause). The prizes were distributed by Miss Greaves, of TanVallt. sister to Mr J. E. Greaves, lord lie'itenant, who arh ised the children not to waste their money on cheup, trashy literature. The halfpenny and penny novelettes were not the stuff to feed their minds on, and their minds wanted as much judicious food as their bodies. She likened the difference between n. penny novelette and a good book to the difference between a bottle of peppermints and a square meal. If they fed their minds on stupid trash they would become stupid and silly themselves. Let them study the lives of great men and women. The highest prize of all was to feel when leaving this world that they were leav- ing it a little better and a little wiser than when they found it. {uppla-use). j\u2014 Mfes: Greaves afterwards distributed prizes to the following:\u2014Form Prizes: Marv Dilys Wil- liams, Criccieth J.

The Permanent Secretary of the Education Department, Mr Kekewich, on Wednesday opened the important extensions which have been made to the Higher Grade School, Cardiff. These extensions have cost \u00a3 10,500, and have been carried out by Mr C. C. Dunn, builder, in a highly satisfactory manner from the designs of Measrs Seward and Thomas, who were the archi- tects of the original school. At the rear of the original schools a fine corridor has been added, about 10ft. in width, -.tn&, from this branches a series of classrooms. But the chief features of the extensions consist of a lecture theatre on the second Moor, which will accommo- date the whole of the students at one gathering, and of a large chemical laboratory, which is well lighted from tae roof, and in regard to the details of which tuearchitects h- d the advantage of the suggestions of Mr Buckmaster, architect to the Education Department. Competent judges de- clare the new laboratory and the lecture-room to be the finest connected with any higher grade school in the country. The extensions are amply provided with classrooms, so that teaching may be carried on under the best conditions. On the arrival of Mr Kekewich at the schools he was presented with a silver key by Mr Lewis Williams, the chairman of the School Board. The key served to open the laboratory, and with this little ceremony performed by Alr Kek-ewicb, an inspection was made of tho handsome laboratory and its fittings and appliances for science teaching. The other members of the Board present, besides Mr Lewis Williams, were Dr Edwards, Rev G. Arthur Jones, Rev Monsignor Williams, Rev Morgan Jones, Rev F. J. Beck, Dr Wallace (chairman of the Higher Grade Schcx-1 Committee), Dr. Treharne, and Rev Alfred Tilly. visitors included Principal Viriamu Jones, Uni versity College of South Wales and Monmouth- shire; Mr C. T. Whitmell, H.M.I.S., Mr Jack- son, inspector under the Cardiff School Board Mr John Gunn and Mr John Duncan, governors of University College; Mr Edwin Seward, F.R.I.B.A.. Councillor Trounce, Mr Ivor James, registrar of University, &c., and they were con- ducted over the now premises by Mr James Waugh, the head master. The inspection of the laboratory over, the company proceeded to the lecture-room, where the pupils were assembled who were to receive prizes, and a number of ladies. Mr LEWIS WILLIAMS, who presided, said the event which had summoned them together was one which the most sanguine friend of education in Cardiff 10 years ago hardly dreamt could possibly happen till, at least, the early part of the twentieth century. But we were living in an age when things moved very rapidly. We believed that the educational movements of to- day would tell upon future ages in upholding and benefitting society, our country, and the whole world. Twelve years ago, when this Higher Grade School was projected, Cardiff was the most backward of the large towns in the kingdom in its provisions for education. To-day they thought they could fairly say, without any boast, that they had but one link missing in their chain, and that they were in a position to compare and to compete with any of their great rivals in the Far North. (Applause.) At one time the estab- lishment of an advanced elementary school in Cardiff hardly met with popular approval, but to-day he felt confident there was no institution in the town more popular than the Higher Grade School. (Hear. hear.) There was no other similar school in England which had such a splendid record in four years as theirs had. Twelve of their students had matriculated at the London University\u2014ten in the first division, only one in the second, and one high up in the list of honours. (Applause.) They in Cardiff were solving the problem how the child of the poorest could climb to the highest educational honours. (Hear, hear.) Dr WALLACE, chairman of the Higher Grade School Committee, stated that :about 2,000 boys had passed, or were passing, through the schools since the establishment of the institution. It bad been found necessary to make additional de- partments, more especially in connection with the scientific side of education, than were originally provided for. The question was often debated whether it wa3 wiser to build a. second Higher Grade School or toextendtheexistingona; and ultimately it was decided\u2014ancl in this they had the cordial concurrence of Professor Rimier\u2014 to concentrate their efforts upon one institution, and provide it with the best and newest appara- tus for the teaching of science. (Applause.) He wished to heartily congratulate Messrs Seward and Thomas, the architects, and Mr C. C. Dunn, the builder, upon the excellent way in which the extensions to th-s school had been carried through, \u2014extensions which, with a little crowding, would accommodate 2,000 pupils. (Applause.) Mr KEKEWICH, who was heartily greeted, con- gratulated the School Board and the town of Cardiff upon the magnificent addition which had been made to their educational resources in these extensions of the Higher Grade School. He commended the Board for its energy and foresight, and especially ff. its ioresight, because it seomed to him that in u grrat industrial centre like Cardiff, sitl11)ed, jn one of m n the largest mining districts in the kingdom, th. need of increased and improved science instruc- tion must become greater every day. He remembered that when the first Higher Grade school was instituted, the project was looked upon with great distrust. It was said at the time that they were already educating the children of the poorer classes quite high enough. Since then the tone had entirely changed. (Hear, hear.) What those who had at heart the welfare of the masses wanted to see was the way of the poorer child, who had ability, made clear and free from the bottom to the top. (Hear, hear). By their system of education\u2014and tha idea was being gradually worked out-they wanted to cull talent frotn whatever source they could get it for the benefit of the country. Not solely from the rieh, as was the case in former times, but from the poorer classes as well, where they had the ability to compete with the rich. (Applause.) In this i connection he should like to say a few words upon the subject of fees. e had always thought that the system of charging higher fees for higher education waa a mistake. It should be exactly tha other way. (Hear. hear.) Fees were no longer charged in their lower grade public elementary schools, but they continued to charge them in their Higher Grade schools. Before the passing of the Free Education Act\u2014 which was a beneficent measure creditable to all concerned in it\u2014school managers used to come to him for advice with regard to the fees they should charge. He was wont to ask them why they did not charpe a fair fee in their Lower Grade School, and as low a fee as possible in their Higher Grade School, and make places in th!\\ Higher Grade School equal to scholarships ? (Applause.) This was the way in which the clever child of poor parents would be enabled to continue its educa- tion from the elementary stages. There were two kinds of Higher Grade Schools in this country. There was the school which was not appropriate to certain standards, but which charged high fees in all its standards, and therefore was a school which lie should call a social class higher grade school. That, however, .was not a real higher grade school, which was a school where children were admitted on account of their special proficiency, and to cbtain a. place in which was regarded as a prize. (Hear, hear.) He desired to see the way of the poor child made free of fees from the bottom of the educational ladder to the top\u2014(applause)\u2014to see those whose abilities promised to ba of great advantage to their country enabled to to go from the lower frade public elementary schools\u2014from the gutter, if he might use the term\u2014right up to the University, or to the highest technical and engineering schools. (Applause.) The higher grade school should be a link in that process. England and Wales were flooded with lower grade public elementary schools, in which children could get a fair modicum of education up to a certain standard-he was afraid it was a very low standard in some cases- without payment of fees. But supposing a. clever child, the son ef poor parents, had reached the highest standard possible in the elementary schools, what was he going to do ? His parents wanted his labour but if they were able to forego it, they had to pay heavy fees for the eontmuation of his education. It was under these circumstances that, not only had higher grade schools arisen, but that there was a move- ment on foot at the present time in favour of secondary education. That movement was not initiated by School Boards, or by people who are in the habit of making speeches upon the subject, but it was initiated by the hunger of the people themselves for higher education and he was glad to see this feeling. (Hear, hear.) If there had been a Y. en i of secondary education in this country, he doubted whether such an institution as the Cardiff Higher Grade School would have been established. In conclusion, Mr Kekewich suggested that a gymnasium should be provided at the school, (an observation that was received with rapturous cheers by the pupils) and again offered his hearty congratulations upon the opening of the new extensions. (Applause.) A warm vote of thanks was passed to Mr Kekewich on the motion of Dr Edwards, seconded by the Rev G. Arthur Jones, and supported by Mr John Gunn, Principal Jones, and the Rev Monsignor Williams, the last-named of whom said the Higher Grade School should not be open so much to those who had money to pay as to thosa who had brains to succeed. Mr Kekewich having acknowledged the compli- ment, the prizes to successful pupils were dis- tributed\u2014to the girls by Mi's Wallace, and to the boys by Dr Wallace.

Williams, Tyn Llwyn, who presided, re- ferred to the small attendance, and said it was sad to think that religious meetings were poorly attended. The Rev. A. Wellcs- ley Jones,- B.A., B.D., Chester, deputation for North Wales, gave an interesting ad- dress, emphasising the changed conditions and relationship between white and black people which would undoubtedly result after the present war. He referred to the enor- mous number of portions of the Bible which the Society had distributed to the soldiers since the commencement of the war, and with regard to an incident mentioned by the president said he would be glad to present copies of the New Testament in Flemish or French to any of the refugees now in this country.

EVANS, I).!).\u2014 An interesting biographical sketch of the Rev Dr Herber Evans adorn the pages of the Christian Pictorial,\" a popular religious illustrated weekly, for August 22nd. It is copiously illustrated with portraits of the subject of the sketch as he appeared thirty, fifteen, and ten years ago, and as 1.;3 is at the pre- sent day. It testifies to Dr Evans's powerful per- sonality, and says that his very presence cannot fail to inspire the students of the Coiiage with en- thusiasm for the ministry,\" for which he specially adapted to teach them.

Williams- Meyrick (Beaumaris) also passed in the requisite number of subjects (five), viz., Latin, Greek, French, arithmetic, and mathematics (with dis- tinction in French), but his certificate was held over owing to an error in the number of groups chosen for examination. G. T. Davies (Bangor) passed in four subjects (one of which was Greek), as also did W. O. Jones (Portdiuorwic), and G. J. Williams (Bangor), and H.

Jones) presided. An address was given by the Lord Bishop of St. David's, who congratulated the head- mistress on the progress the school was making, and urged parents to take a greater interest in the studies of their children. The Warden of Llandovery College (Rev. W. Poole-Hughes) deprecated the practice of taking away from the school children who had only spent a term or two there. He hailed with satisfaction the teaching of Euclid and Latin, even if only as mental gymnastics. The number of students was reported to be 38, as compared with 40 in the summer term. The head-mistress (Miss Price) advocated the establishment of a boarding house for children coming trom a distance. The prizes, of which the following is a list, were dis- tributed by Mrs Owen, wife of the Bishop of St. Davidls:-Form VI. Mathematics and botany, My- fanwy Richards; French Edith Davies; Latin, Gwen Griffiths. Form V.: English and mathematics, Nelly Allen; languages and botany, Hannah Thomas.

THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL.\u2014The results of the ex- aminations held simultaneously by the examining boards of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, in the public schools of England and Wales, have been published within the last few days. It may not be generally known that the standard necessary to qualify for certificates is somewhat higher than that of Responsions at Oxford and the Previous Examinations at Cambridge and that these cer. tificates are not only valuable to those who enter the universities, but are accepted also by the examining boards of the legal and medical pro- fessions as more than equivalent to the require- ments of the preliminary eximinations. The whole of the highest form at this school, consisting of six boys, competed for the certificates; the very favourable reports of the examiners have already appeared in our columns, and we are pleased to find that those reports have been fully borne out by the recent awards as given below: -Certificates: J. Humphreys passed in Latin, Greek, Elementary Mathematics, Scripture Knowledge and History. J. R. Roberts passed in Latin, Greek, Elementary Mathematics, Scripture Knowledge and History, and obtained distinction in Greek. W. Lifton Wynne passed in Latin, Greek, Elementary and Advanced Mathematics, and Scripture Know- ledge, and History. W. Wynne passed in Latin, Elementary and Advanced Mathematics, and Scriphre Knowledge. W. A. Lewis satisfied the examiners in Elementary and Advanced Mathe- matics and Scripture Knowledge. We believe that we are correct in stating that Roberts was the only candidate from the Welsh schools who obtained distinction in Greek.",

The fifty-third annual meeting of the British Association commenced at Southport, on Wednes- day night, when Dr. Cayley, professor of pure mathematics at Cambridge, succeeded Sir W. Siemens in tho presidency, and delivered his opening address to a brilliant gathering cf ladies and gentlemen, in the Theatre of the Winter Gardens. He discoursed on the progress of mathematics from the earnest times, mentioning those philosophers to whom the science has b\u00b0en most deeply indebted, describing the question in connection with the other sciences that stimulated then- endeavours in its pursuit, and led to their principal discoveries. He also entered to some extent into the contro- versy that has arisen since John Stuart Mill tnrew doulJt on the soundness of the method of previous philosophers' truths of geometry. He liVoi of his opinion in the scale against Mill. _Tne address was listened to with evident appreciation by those who have studied the higher mathematics, but somewhat listlessly by the rest of the audience. There is a great increase in the number of tickets issued, compared with the Southampton meeting last year. The total is already 2,293.",

Thomas is one of the mathematical sharks of the country and by mental processes ha3 developed a hundred or more short cuts to correct answers in mathematics. His latest achievement is the completion of a square of 1600 figures, in forty horizontal lines and forty vertical lines, using the numerals from 1 to 1600 without repetitions. Each line, whether added .\u00a1. horizontally, vertically or diagonally, makes the same total 32,020. The grand total of the numerals Is 1,280,800. Thomas left school when he was nine years old and has studied mathematics for amuser ment. \"How many times does a clock strike in twelve hours? he asked, and when the person questioBed began a mental addition of the digits he protested. No, that's not the way. Add the extremes and multiply by the mean. The sum of the extremes is 13 and the mean is 6.

A matter of serious import to intend- ing students of the Mountain Ash Urban District, Evening Classes is the recom- mendation of Dr. James (Chief Educa- tion Official of the County) that the fol- lowing classes be discontinued: Cae- garw, elementary dressmaking; Cefn- pennar, scientific dressmaking; Duffryn Evening Continuation School; County School, Mathematics; Penrhiwceiber, music (theoretical and vocal, scientific dressmaking, elementary dressmaking, and art needlework; all classes at Ynys- boeth; Navigation, elementary dress- making; Trerobert, Mathematics, French, and Music (theoretical and vocal). Many and various are the reasons given for the suggested discon- tinuance. The average attendances have been very fair, and ranging from 9 to as high as 23. The County School Mathematics Class had an average at- tendance of 20 during 1906-7, and last session of 11, yet this important class, which is the only one for Mountain Ash and Penrhiwcenber, is threatened with extinction for the reason that it is \"not necessary.\" It is sincerely to be hoped that our local representatives on the County Education Committee will fight this question, and also that further re- commendation from the Urban District Education Committee will be promptly despatched in order to prevent what will be a serious loss to those desirous of improving themselves. v",

A meeting, of teachers wholly or partly engag.e.d in teaching mathematical subjects (from arithmetic upwards) in schools or in- stitutions of every grade in North Wales was held at the mathematical lecture-room, of the University College, Bangor, on Wednesday last week. The chair was occupied by Professor Bryan, President of the Mathematical Association. The following resolutions were submitted to the meeting.:\u2014 (1) \"Tliat in view of the numerous re- cent changes in the methods of teaching elementary mathematics, there exists a need of some medium for the interchange of ideas and discussion, of questions relat- ing to such teaching. (2) That this object can best be attained by the formation of a, North Wales branch of the Mathematical Association.\" The resolutions were unanimously cur- ned.-T,h,e. Chairman read a letter from Mr Osborne, Rydal Mount School, supporting the resolutions, and asking to be enrolled as a member of the association, if it was formed. He (the Chairman) then dwelt upon the advantages of the association and the objects of 'mathematics in education.",

The fifty-third annual meeting of the British Association commenced at Southport, on Wednes- day night, when Dr. Cay ley, professor of pure mathematics at Cambridge, succeeded Sir W. Siemens in the presidency, and delivered his opening address to a brilliant gathering of ladies and gentlemen, in the Theatre of the Winter Gardens. He discoursed on the progress of mathematics from the earliest times, mentioning those philosophers to whom the science has been most deeply indebted, describing the question in connection with the other sciences that stimulated their endeavours in its pursuit, and led to their principal discoveries. He also entered to some extent into tha contro- versy that has arisen since John Stuart Mill threw doubt on the soundness of the method of previous philosophers' truths of geometry. He lent the weight of his opinion in the scale against Mill. The address was listened to with evident appreciation by those who have studied the higher mathematics, but somewhat listlessly by the rest of the audience. There is a great increase in the number of tickets issued, compared with the Southa.mpton meeting last year. The total is already 2,293.",

Morgan, Llangadog, he attended the Pupil Teachers' Centre at Llaudilo under Mr G. Gwyn Jones, B.A., and passed the preliminary certificate examination (old King's Scholarship) first on the list for North and South Wales. He was trained at Bangor Normal College, where he was mathematics prizeman, and gained his certificate in 1908, with distinctions in advanced mathematics, ordinary mathematics, history and geography, and physics. He was also an ardent sports- man, being captain of the Bangor Rugbv team and also winner of the inter-collegiate 100 yds. race in 1908. On leaving college that year he took up an appointment under the Barry Edu- cation Authority, and for some time was on the staff of Barry Island School. Sincere sympathy is felt for his bereaved parents and his brother, Mr Jake Morgan, of Jesus College.",

The news of the death of Mr. Hudson, lec- turer on mathematics at Liverpool Univer- sity, while on a climbing expedition on Snow- don, created a painful sensation. He was yesterday climbing near the dangerous Devil's Kitchen, and while trying to secure a rare fern he fell headlong to the bottom. The body, badly mangled, was recovered with great difficulty. Six years ago deceased was senior wrangler, and had been at Liverpool University for two years. He was 27 years of age. Mr. Hudson was recognised as one of the most brilliant mathematicians of the day among the younger Cambridge men. He had in the press two works on mathe- matics, the publication of which was awaited with interest. He had done a large amount of original work in higher mathematics, and his reputation was rapidly extending beyond his own country. He was much loved by the staff and students of Liverpool University. Deceased was an accomplished musician, and excelled as a solo pianist. He was the son of Mr. W. H. Hudson, professor of mathema- tics, King's College, London, a former third wrangler, and his two sisters are distin- guished at Cambridge in mathematics.",

The prize distribution in connection *iih the Newport Intermediate School for Boys took place in tho centoal hall of the school on Thursday. As Lord Tre&egar was unable to attend, Aid. EL J. Davis presided. He was supported by Prin- cipal Reichel (Vice Chancellor of the University of Wales) and Mrs Reichel, Mr Moses Wheeler, and Aid T. Jones (chairman and vice-chairman of the Board of Governors), and most of the members of the board. The Chairman gave interesting personal reminiscences of schools and school methods 80 years ago, aud pointed out that boys were now taught, in addition to the dead and modern languages, all the branches of educa- tion upon which he had had to educate himself after leaving school, The school library of 2,000 volumes was not the least of the advantages which the boya of the Newport Intermediate School enjoyed. Mr T. W. Phillips, the head- master, presented the annual report. The scholars had increased in number, the total now being 153. Out of the 150 boys 100 had come from Board schools. Two boy-W. J. Martin and G. A. F. Heward-who four years ago entered the school from a Board school after winning scholarships, had since matriculated, and had now entered college with honours. W. J. Martin also won the championship trophy as the best all-round athlete in the schools. Principal Reichel dealt with the bearing of education upon the practical business of life. He p\"inted out that the success of Scotsmen in all departments of life aud as colonists was due to the system of schools and colleges which had been established in Scotland since the Re for m-ttion. The result of the work of a schoo! should be judged by the number of capable citizens which it turned out. Mrs Reichel afterwards distributed the prises and certificates as,follow :\u2014 Form I.\u2014Form prize, drawing, and manual work, H. Blow; English and science, P. E. Thomas: mathematics, V.

Lewis and H. C. Beavan. Principal Rhys in the course of an interesting address said popils should be tanght to observe what they saw around them, whether it was animal life or inorganic When he waa a boy he WaIJ taught to observe i nothing bnt the Sabbath. (Langhter.) Of course that was very go so far as i: went. Welshmen were fond of siDging, bat he should like to see Wales figuring more in the study of music from the scientific standpoint. Referring to the educa- tion of girls, he said be waa afraid that Wales waa verymnuch behind in the matter, for until quite recently by far the larger number of girls at some of their University Colleges were Eng- lish. He hoped, however, that it was becoming more of the fashion now to have girls educated. He failed to see that geology was taught at this school, which was in the very midst of one of tbe moat, wealthy geological districts in I the Kingdom. It was indeed astonishing that this subject was left out. The governors should think of it. He also regretted that Greek waa notr'uclnded in the curriculum. During the evening a number of girls went through the Swedish drill in a manner that elicited much applause, whilst .the boys and girls alao rendered a chorus.",

SALE OF G ARTHGAVYNION ESTATE. The freehold residential and agricultural estate known as Garthgwynion on the borders of Montgomeryshire and Cardiganshire, in the lovely Llyfnant Y alley, was offered for ale on Wednesday afternoon at the AVvnil- stay Hotel, Machynlleth. The estate, which iFj situated closo to the Dovey Estuary, about three miles from Machynlleth and seventeen miles from Aberystwyth, comprises an area of upwards of 1,200 acres and includes an ivy-clad family residence of moderate dimen- sions, a secondary residence known as Caer- taer, eight mixed rarms and small holdings, and a number of cottages. It is also abund- antly timbered, possesses excellent sporting qualifications, a\u00bbnd includes the most inter- esting section of Llyfnant Valley. Mr. David GiHart (of Messrs Gillart and Sons, auctioneers, Machynlleth) conducted the sale I and Mr. Crosskey, Binuillgham\" was present as solicitor on behalf of tne trustees of the late 8Lr Henry Wiggin_ vendors. There was a very large attendance. In opening tho sale, the Auctioneer said --It is seldom indeed that an auctioneer has to offer fiJr aie a propertv possessing stieli attractions as the one which 1 have nowxthe privilege of introducing to your notice. it is not necessary for me to try and describe the Garthgwynion propertv in detail, and I shail not attempt to do that, but I am sure that most, if not all of you who arc here this afternoon are s,ufficient)ly well acquainted with the property to fully appreciate its num- erous attractive features. As to the situa- tion, it can be honestiy said that thi- is really splendid. The estate forms practically the entire northern side of the Llyfnant Valley which is undoubtedly one of the, most beautiful spots in Wales. The disposition of the estate, too, is extremely advantageous. Instead of the holdings being divided and scattered ovea a large area, as we sometimes find, this estate lies well together, forming a compact wedge, as it were, with well-defined boundaries. I need not tell you that this is in many respects an important consideration. The majority of the holdings making up the estate are well timbered, and in some cases the value of such tilnoer is very considerable. Therte are also some L-i,ii-i;ig young planta- tions. which promise to turn out well. All timber will be included in the purchase price. The sporting on the estate as a whole is a prominent feature. There is no doubt that the shooting is quite one of the very best in the district. Altogether this is such a charm- t; ing residential property that it would be the most natura. thinp- to offer it for sale in the first instance as one lot. The farms are some of the most useful in our neighbour- hood\u2014g&od mixed fa/rms, most cil them fur- nishing capital pasturage and with a fair proportion of arable. All the lands, broadly speaking, have a sunny aspect and are in good condition, being also well supplied with water. In most oases there is an ample supply of timber for purposes of repair. The estate was then offered in one lot and bidding commenced at \u00a3 9,000, but rose by bids of \u00a3100 to \u00a3 10^300. The Auctioneer ex- plained that the annual income of the estate was \u00a3 486 and the outgoings amounted to \u00a3 39 only. The principal bidders were Mr. Rider, Leek, Staffordshire, and Mr. Owen Owen, draper, Liverpool. Eventually, the whole estate was knocked down to the latter at -010,500 amid cheers.",

The grand stand is being put up on the fine park belonging to Neptune Hall. The work is under the superintendence of Dr J. F. Jones, the energetic local secretary of the society, and the contract is let to Mr Morris James, builder, Warwick-place, who, with his characteristic promptness, has got the grand stand in a very for- ward state. The stand will seat about 1,000, and protection against the weather is being provided. The hurdling out of the several sections is being done by Mr Henry Jones, builder, who also has his work well in hand. THE HOPE OF FUTURE YEARS.-That those who live by visitors will prppare more for their comfort while they stay on the coast. That those who wor- ship in temples will put the roof on them before another year is over. That those who own the streams in the neighbourhood will allow respectable visitors to fish in them, and not keep all the sport for those who blacken their faces in the winter and guide their steps not by the light of the sun, moon and stars, but by torch light. That the Noncon-' formists of the Principality will hold their princi- pal meetings in the day time and not at night as heretofore. RAILWAY SERVICE.-The trains as a rule are heavily laden and arrive late. The company could appropriately state six for aeven prompt on their time tables. The staff all along the coast have a hard time of it. They have enough and to spare to do in winter. What mustbe their lot now, when the traffic is more than ten times as heavy. And visitors when they come to the coast awake sud- denly to the sense of their importance, and shout on the poor officials as if they were so many sheep- dogs at an agricultural show. The visitors, to keep up their dignity do not get to the stations till the last moment, then twenty at a time often shout on the single porter to label their luggage to as many different stations, and put so many articles be- longing to each shouter in the carriage with him, under many pains and penalties. Happy is the life of the porter when the storms come to drive these people away. LLANYCHAIARN. SCHOOL BO.ARD.-At a special meeting of the board, held on Monday week, in the Town Hall Aber- ystwyth, Mr R. R. Davies, Cofadail board school, was elected master, in place of Mr H. Williams, who has resigned, having obtained a more lucrative schooi in North Wale*. All the members of the board were present-yiz, Messrs Vaughan Davies (chairman), John James, (vice-chairman), L. P. Pugh, M.P., Rev D. Jenkins, Messrs D. Rees, W. Morgan, and E. Lloyd. TREAT AT TANYBWLCH.\u2014On Tuesday week, the children of the Llanychaiarn board school were treated to tea, cake, fruit, &c., at Tanybwlch, by Mr Vaughan Davies, chairman of the Llanychaiarn school board. This i* the seventh annual entertain- ment given by Mr Davies to the school since its opening in 1876. The children, having assembled in the schoolroom, marched in procession towards Tanybwlch, flags and banners adorning the ranks. Having arrived there, they were conducted inside the house, where tables covered with cake and fruit were prepared for them. Having sang the grace, they soon did justice to the good things set before them. The Rev D. Jenkins, Messra W. Morgan and E. Lloyd, together with Mr and Mrs Williams, in another reom sat down to a grand dinner; while Mr Davies was busily engaged in attending to the comforts of the children. The whole party then assembled- in front of the house, when Mr Davies distributed prizes to those children who had attended most regalarly and obtained the greatest number of marks for their lessons. The master addressed the children, and in response to his call, they gave hearty cheers to their kind bene- factor. Mr Davies thanked them, and said I am always glad to see you here, and take great interest in your welfare. Your progress and your success I view with pleasure, but I am exceedingly sorry to inform you that this is the last time we shall see your master, Mr Williams, with you here. He opened the school, and exerted himself to bring it on to be a credit to his, to as, and to you. He has laid the foundation for you to become good and great men and women. He always passed the school exceedingly well before the inspector, and has given entire satisfaction to the board, to your parents, and to all concerned. He has done more he has taught you to be honest, truthful, obedient and good children, and lam sure he will take-interest in you even after he leaves here. I hope he will be as successful in his new school, and that he will also train them to be good children. He carries with him to his new home the good wishes of everybody. Mr Davies then called for three cheers for Mr Williams, then for Mrs Williams, which were heartily given, the children being very much attached to them, and feel losing them extremely. Having expressed their gratitude to Mr Davies for his magnificence, the wholo party returned home. LLANDOVERY. THE SCHOOL. -The following are the full and cor- rect results gained by this school in the Oxford and Cambridge Schools Examination Board E. J. Davies passed in Latin, Greek, elementary mathe- matics, scripture knowledge, history. W. T. Davies passed in Latin, Greek, elementary mathe- matics, scripture knowledge. A. Hill passed in Latin, Greek, elementary mathematics, scripture knowledge, and history, with distinction. J. P. Hughes passed in Greek, elementary mathematics, scripture knowledge, and history. W. P. Hughes passed in Latin, Greek, and in elementary and ad- ditional mathematics, with distinction. T. L. H. Jenkin passed in Greek, elementary mathematics, scripture knowledge, and history. J. Eyton Jones passed in Latin, Greek, elementary mathematics, and history. J. H. W. Jones passed in Latin, ele- mentary mathematics, and scripture knowledge. R. E., Leigh passed in Latin, Greek, and elementary mathematics. D. T. Lewis passed in Latin, Greek, elementary mathematics, scripture knowledge, and history. J. H. Lewis passed in Latin, Greek, ele- mentary mathematics, and seriptnre knowledge. A. B. Brice passed in elementary mathematics and ad- vanced mathematics, with distinction. J. F. Rees passed in Latin, Greek, and elementary mathema- tics. T. W. Roliinsen passed in blementarv and ad- ditional mathematics with distinction, and in me- chanical philosophy. D. Thomas passed in Latin, Greek, elementary mathematies, scripture know- ledge, and history. J. O, M. Thomas passed in Latin, Greek, and scripture knowledge. E. E. M. Tozer passed in natural philosophy, chemical divi- sion. T. H. J. Watts passed in natural philosophy mechanical and chemical division, with distinction. W. L. Williams passed in Latin, Greek, elementary mathematics, scripture knowledge, and history. D. M. Jones, the head boy in the school, was absent from the examination owing to illness, and E. J. Davies passed in the subjects for a certificate, but will net be awarded the formal Testamwr,\" as his name was entered too late fer the examination. It will be seen by the above that ten boys qualified for certificates, and five gained distinctions.\" In ad. vanced mathematics only 40 distinctions were gained this year by all the schools examined in England and Wales, and Llandovery carried off three dis- tinctions in fact, all the Llandovery boys who offered advanced mathematics gained distinctions This is a very remarkable result. \"Reputation serves to virtue what light does to a picture.\" \"The heart ought to give charity when the hand cannot.\" \"Necessity never made a good bargain,\"",

THE VOLUNTEER BAZAAR.\u2014Owing to the deplorable fatal accident to Colonel Naylor Leyland, the Bazaar fixed for this week has been postponed until Thursday and Friday, September 16th and 17th. We feel sure that the promoters will not suffer by this postponement, but that many sympathisers with the Leyland family will appreciate the motives which have led to deferring the Bazaar and thoroughly support it when it does take place. GRAMMAR SCHOOL EXAMINATIONS.\u2014The result of the examination recently conducted by the Oxford and Cambridge Board of Examiners were published some days ago. So far as we can gather three only of the leading Welsh schools are represented in the examination this year\u2014Christ College, Brecon, Llandovery College, and Ruthin Grammar School, although the number of candidates sent up by the English Schools has increased very considerably. We append some details as to the success of the candidates from the last mentioned school, as so many of our readers take an interest in its welfare. Senior Certificates: C. Goodman Jones passed in Latin, Greek, Elementary Mathematics, and Scrip- ture, Lower Certificates: Arthur John Jones and Arthur Lloyd Jones passed in Latin, Greek, Ele- mentary Mathematics, Scripture, and History, the former obtained distinction in Greek, the latter in Greek and Scripture.

The annual \"speech day\" and prize distri- bution in connection with thci Carnarvon County School, took place on Thursday, when the prizes were distributed by Professor Hudson William, At. A., of the North Wales University College, Bangor. There was a large attendance of parents and others in- terested in the school. Mr J. Issard Davies (chairman of the Governors) presided, and in opening the proceedings, congratulated both the govern- ors and the staff upon the fact that the school had once more done- good work,though it had not gained quite; as many honours last year as in previous years, it had passed in proportion to those who had entered as many as any other school in North Wales (hear, hear). It was very evident, that honest, even work had been accomplished, and that all the attention was. not concen- trated upon a few clever pupils. Referring to the curriculum of the school, he comment- ed upon the fact that there were two sub- jects. namely, scripture knowlege, and hygiene and domestic science, which were not accorded the prominence which theiir importance deserved. That was a, weakness, he regretted to sav. which applied to all the county schools of the Principality. There were between 13,000 and 14,000 children in the intermediate schools of Wales, and he believed that out of that number only 714 were examined in Scripture in the higher stages. Of those examined again, 196 were among the seniors, and of the latter 164 came from GIatmorganshire. and what he might call other English-speaking portions of Wales, while out of 572 exanlined in the junior stages, 355 came from South Wales. The Welsh people had always pr.idad them- selves upon the fact that if they knew any- thing, they knew their Bible, and yet the in- ference to be drawn from the figures he had quoted was, that only in the English-speak- ing portion of the country was Scripture taught in the higher stages. He was con- vinced that once Scripture was relegated jntoan unimportant position in the school, it would not be very long before it would also take ,an unimportant position in the mind of the child, and lie hoped that. as fail* as that school and all other secondary schools in Wales were concerned, Scripture would have the place which it deserved. As to hygiene and domestic economy, ha pointed out that out of 96 schools in Wales, educating 8,000 #irls, only 11 sent in surips in those subjects at the last examination, so that 95 per cent of those pupils returned to their home-firesides ill-equipped for home life (hear, hear).

Professor Hudson Williams, in the course of a fe.w remarks, congratulated the sohool on ito marked success. The children should take a pride in their aichool, a:nd it should be the anm of both pupi'ls and.' staff to make a name for their school as one of the best, in Wales.. They came. to school to learn, but after aJJ1 it was not what they iearnlt that mattered, but wfaait they were. They shlOluJd make: knowledge a part oif themselves. Teachers should make the best use of Ioca: features' and bring every day life into close connection with, the work of the school. This principle had been made use of in a gre.ait many instances, but unfortunalte'lv in other branches of knowledge it was still lacking. They should be now training their children \u2022for the rights and duties of citizenship. They should teach them more about local history, local conditions, and local bodies. That seemed to be a defect in a good many schools. Thej seemed to has'e a horror of modern Kisltory'. Was it r-igjit thatt they should t \u00a3 ach more about the Star ChamheT and tihe tea tax in America than about other present day taxes? ISbme attention should be given to recent history and loc.aJ! institutions. The pirpils should; b? made, acquainted' as far a-s possible with the work of town councils, parish councils, boards of guardians, etc. It should be the duty OI\u00cd the teachers to kin- dle the ima^gfiniation of the pu.oiils to a living flame by showing him what wae being done in his own district (applause). On the motion of the Headmaster, second- ed by Mr Phillips, voteis of tlraniks were :accorde.d h\u00fcith the chairman and Professor Hudson Williams.

SIR,\u2014At the Llandovery School Prize-day on July 27th I took the opportunity of drawing atten- tion to the fact that four of the Welsh schools had been placed by their governing bodies under the Oxford and Cambridge Schools Examination Board, and I pointed out the advantages which arise from a school's being submitted in that way to an extraneous and authoritative examination, which affords also a rough general comparison of its teaching with that of other schools of the country. The mode by which the comparison is arrived at is as follows: The Universities' which conduct the examinations offer certificates of merit to such candidates as reach certain standards of attainment, and grant distinctions to surh of them as exhibit marked proficiency. The ordinary pass standard is somewhatlabove that for Responsions at Oxford the standard for distinction is probably that for an open scholarship at a good college, so that the honour of distinction is a real one. Some fifty or sixty schools have been examined this year by the Board, including some of the most important public schools of England, as well as Brecon, Cowbridge, Llandovery, and Swansea Schools, and 734 boys were presented as candidates for certificates. The results were published on Saturday last, and I ask your insertion of a few notes upon them, as highly interesting to all who are concerned in the promotion of Higher Education in Wales. The statistics show that, of the 734 candidates, 384 obtained certificates as having satisfied the examiners in four subjects at least. Of these nine came from Christ's College, Brecon, one from Cow- bridge. nine from Llandovery, two from Swansea. The n head boy at Llandovery was unfortunately absent through illness, or an additional certificate would doubtless have been credited to that school. Of the Brecon candidates eleven passed in Latin, ten in Greek, nine in elementary mathematics, three in higher mathematics (one of them with distinction), seven in history (no fewer than four of them with distinction), twelve in Scripture knowledge. The Cowbridge candidate satisfied the examiners in Latin, Greek, elementary mathematics, and Scripture knowledge. Of the Llandovery candidates twelve passed in Latin, thirteen in Greek, sixteen in elementary mathematics, three in higher mathematics (and all three of them with distinction), seven in history (one being distinguished), ten in Scripture know- ledge, two in natural science (mechanical division) and two in chemistry (one of them with distinction)' Of the Swansea candidates, three satisfied the examiners in Latin (one being distinguished), two in Greek, two in elementary mathematics, two in -higher mathematics (both being distinguished), and three in scripture knowledge. The four Welsh schools are, therefore, represented by twenty-seven passes\" in Latin, out of a total number of 491 twenty-six in Greek, out of 468 twenty-eight in elementary mathematics, out of 444; eight in higher mathematics, out of 208 twenty- six in scripture knowledge, out of 486; fourteen in history, from Brecon and Llandovery, out of 344; two, from Llandovery, in mechanics, out of eighteen and two, also from Llandovery, in chemistry out of twenty-three. In distinctions, one boy from Swansea is distin- guished in Latin out of a total of fifty-one boys distinguished in that subject; six boys from Welsh schools are distinguished in mathematics out of a total of forty and five in history out of forty-two; and one boy from Llandovery is distinguished in chemistry out of a total of eight. The distinctions in mathematics and history are above the average number to be expected. Had only selected boys been sent up for certifi- cates the evidence afforded of the condition of the schools generally would be worthless;; but the whole Sixth Forms were sent up from Brecon and Llan- dovery, and the large number of boys who satisfy the examiners in each subject affords undeniable evidence of the goodness of the teaching throughout. The fact that fourteen boys from Brecon and Llandovery pass in history and five of them with distinction is especially significant, for that honour, implies good and fluent English composition as well as historical knowledge. The two boys also from Swansea have received and been able to profit by good teaching. I heartily con- gratulate both the masters and the boys upon the position occupied by their schools in the published lists. I do not know any school in England at which teaching of the same character and quality can be obtained at as little cost as at Brecon and Llan- dovery. This is a great boast for them, but I fear that the teaching is given at less than cost price, and that the reputation of the schools is being maintained by the self-sacrifice of head-masters who are contented to find their sole reward in the good work they are doing. I have the best reasons for knowing that the total income from endowment and tuition fees is inadequate for the proper remunera- tion of even the assistant masters. I am, sir, your obedient servant, HUGO D. HARPER. Jesus College, Oxford, Sept. 1, 1882.

The Headmaster (Mr. Rees Thomas, B.A.), in the course of an able address, said that on the subject of education our decision was being made, for he could not think that Mr. Fisher's bill, which was now before Parliament, would be abandoned or much further delayed. Local education authorities would have wide powers and extended influence.He anticipated that as far as children were concerned, the Poor Law would be abolished and that the care of all juvenile life would come into the hands of the Education Committees. To the local education authorities will be entrused the education of children, not only in the intellect- ual sense, but also in the physical. It would be their duty to see that the child became strong in body as well as in mind for the hard tussle that lay in front of it. We must not force the child into the labour market too soon. A farmer knew that he lessened the value of a horse if he broke it in before the time wjttcli experience had taught to be the proper time. To make a child commence work too early was to impair it physically and to shorten its period of usefulness. The Breconshire Education Committee was an admirable public body, and he had with pleasure noted that it was one of the first to move on the question of village libraries but he respectfully suggested that it could do a great deal more for the encourage- ment of medical science. He had two girl pupils who would proceed in September to Cardiff for a course in medical study. They were the daughters of comparatively poor men, and he found that there were only about two open scholarships available for them, and those were awarded by the University authorities. If they lived in Glamorganshire they would be eligible for a large number of scholraships, but they were eligible for nothing in their own I",

To the Editor of the\" Llangollen Advertiser.\" Sir,-A petition is being numerously signed fo r telegraphio facilities to be placed at Garth. Now, I don't think it is generally knowrt that Post-office1 Authorities reqaire a guarantee, say of about \u00a3 30 before they will risk placing a telegraph line top Garth, thereby making sure no loss falls on the Post-office, so of course, if it does not pay the ratepayers are responsible for any loss incurred. I would like to point out the class of visitors who use a telegraph office does not visit Garth. Why f The answer is very simple. There is no accom- modation for the business man or his family. The works at Trevor and Garth, also the private houses belonging to the same, are in telephonic communi- cation wi h Ruabon Post-office, and I'm sure the inhabitants of Garth don't 8end or receive a seore of telegrams per year. I question if the oldest inhabitant has ever seen a telegram. I am told the telegraph office at Vron does not pay, so why add. to the number. Far better that Garth would see to getting a good water supply and not depend on the rain-tub and pump. Yours, etc., TREVOR. September 12th, 1910. \u00bb QLYN SHEEP DOG TRIALS. A meeting of the committee was held at tha Ceiriog Hotel, on Saturday evening, when Mr. Edgar Foulkes presided. The Secretary presented a state- ment of the receipts and payments, aDd stated that he had received from Mr. J. Moses the medal which he offered for the novice who showed the best control over his dog, and, according to the judges' decision, he had forwarded the medal to Mr. E Roberts. Berllenhelig. Mr. Moses will offer a medal under the same conditions at next year's trials. The? Chairman stated that the last show was most suc- cessful, and the Secretary had done his worlif thoroughly. The great help given the Society by generous supporters was very encouraging. He was very pleased to see so many patrons on the field on the day of the trials. A discussion took place as to the advisability of changing the day on which the trials are held so as to give competitors who cannot attend on Saturdays an opportunity of competing.. It was said that many shows were being held on the same date as the Ceiriog Valley trials. Ulti- mately, it was decided to leave the matter is abeyance for the present. On the motion of Mr. S Davies, Gelli, it was agreed to transfer :\u00a35 from the general funds to the cup fund. At the Committee's unanimous request, Mr. Rigar Foulkes agreed to audit the accounts and report upon them at the next meeting. The Secretary was also requested to send printed copiee of the balance sheet to all subscribers and members of the Committee. \u00bb LLANGOLLEN COUNTY SCHOOL.

Mr Thomas here read. the communication to the satisfaction and delight of all present as follows \"Sunny Side, Shell Avenue, February 16th, 1916. Dear --vlr Thomas,-Vivian and I are still enjoying our 'Cook's Tour' in France. At pres- ent we are back in billets, some little distance be- hind the firing-line. When we came out first, we were attached to a very fine regiment-our National Guards, and, from them, we learnt quite a lot. Now we are- numbered amongst the 'young veterans,' and carry on independently. Our holidays in the trenches have been very in- teresting. The life is fascinating, for, it carries with it the atmosphere of uncertainty, and, also, a. deep feeling of comradeship, especially in the front-line. We get our share of work, and, up-to- date, we have carried out our programme suc- cessfully. The actual fighting does not amount to much, as climatic conditions do not favour any great movement, but, in addition, there is much to be done in connection with fatigues\u2014repairing para- pets, etc., etc. One thing is very obvious, and that is, our Welsh fellows can hold their own with any English regiment for real hard work. The brigade has received very flattering reports from the Corps Headquarters, and, altogether, we are pleasing the 'brass hats.' We move about a great deal whilst 'resting,' and get stationed at very funny quarters. Our last billet consisted of a detached back- kitchen of an old farm-house. It contained, in the way of furniture, one small table, five chairs, one large cupboard, and a brazier. The wall- paper certainly had seen many years service. The window-frames still existed, but, in the place of glass, we sported sheets of linen, sides of bis- cuit tins-, sacking, etc. The glass had long since left us, owing to the fact that snugly ensconced in the one-time back garden was a tiny elephant gun. It was seldom fired, but we had the pleas- ure of hearing it speak several times. In its ter- ror the poor linen tore itself asunder, and the sacking collapsed in disgust; then, we had a lib- eral allowance of fresh air until the window was re-deoorated. Now, our mess-room in this village is very dif- ferent. We have a comfortable room and a jolly fire, and are billeted with an aged couple\u2014hus- band and wife. They are generous and most ob- liging. The old lady might be anything between the ages of 70 and 120. (N.B.\u2014I was never good at guessing ladies' ages) with a face that resem- bles a well detailed relief map-the northern portion adorned with a huge pair of spectacles, and the southern enclosed in a continual smile. The old man seems to exist in an enormous pair of pantaloons, tied tt the bottom with string\u2014has a well-seasoned face, with a good crop of baby whiskers\u2014lively Mid amusing.

On Monday night, at the Aberdare Arms Coffee Tavern, Mountain Ash, Lord Aberdare distri- buted prizes and certificates to the successful students of the Science and Art Schools. His lordship, on entering the room, which was crowded with an appreciative audience, was received with great applause. His lordship was accompanied by the Hon. Lily and Pamela Bruce, Mr Napier Miles, the Misses Ducane, and Lady Mary Gore. At the schools during the year instruction was given in eight subjects, viz.:\u2014Machine construc- tion and drawing (teacher, Mr D. Lioyd); pure mathematics (Mr A. Morgan) applied mechanics (Mr D. Lloyd); magnetism and electricity (Mr E. D. Hoskins); geology (Mr M. Morgan); animal physiology (Mr L. A. F. Prior); mining (Mr E. D. Hoskin); and steam (Mr D. Lloyd). The following is the alphabetical certificate and prize list:\u2014 Fred HI liell, machine construction, applied mechanics, steam; Albert C 'nicy, machine construction, applied mechanics, steain Edwin Charles, pure mathematics, electricity; J M Churchill, pure mathematics, elec- tricity ;s W J Cale, electricity; Dd T Davies, machine construction; I.ewis Davie. pure mathematics and electricity David Davies (19), mining David Davies (24). mining David Evans, mining; Lewis Griffiths, S W Hale, machinery construction, applied mechanics, and steam E D Hoskins, geology, steam Sarah Ann Hoskins, geology Ernest Harpur, pure mathematics, electricity; Gwilym D Johns, steam James E Johns, machine construction, electricity, and steam W G Jeffries, machine construction W C Jago, pure mathematics David Jones, mining^; \\V W Llovd, mar-hematics and steam\"; Dan Lloyd, pare mathematics, and electricity; W Morgan, geology; Margaret Morgan, electricity Alfred Morgan, geology; Francis Nicholas, mining L E F Prior, geology; J Powell, mining; Thomas Richards, machine construction; W H 'Reynolds, pure mathematics; W Scourefield, machine construction; James Swinnerton, machine construction; Fred. Stock, physiology; Thos. Thomas, steam; Dr Thomas, machine construction, steam, and applied mathematics; Lewis Williams, machine construction, applied mathematics, steam; W Williams (23). ;mining W Williams (35), do.; Hy. Williams, do.; Violette A White, electricity; Thos. Williams, geology; T J R Watkins, naming; and Edward Williams, do. The proceedings were commenced with a song by Miss Jones. Dr Bates then delivered an in- teresting lecture on Circulation of the Blood.\" Having presented the prizes and certificates, Lord Aberdare delivered an address, in which he said he was glad to see signs of steady, if not large, growth in connection with the classes. Perhaps it was more likely to ba steady if it was not large. Their history had been one of steady progress. He found, for instance, that the number of students who joined the classes last year was 106, against 93 in the year before. It was not a large gain, but it was an appreciable gain. Lord Aberdare then dwelt on the importance of the different subjects taught. Pure mathematics, he might say, were the foundation of all scientific knowledge and study. Therefore one was very glad to see so many attending the classes on that subject. He spoke of the pleasure derivable from the study of natural history. His lordship referred incidentally to the value of the labours of Sir William Grove, a schoolfellow of his, who bad attained great eminence as a judge, but more distinction in respect of lasting discoveries in chemistry, particularly discoveries of the laws concerning the composition of water. Alluding to the contrast between the advantages enjoyed by the masses at present and the state of affairs which obtained years ago, the speaker said that the satisfaction with which they surveyed the change that had been effected was not unalloyed. He was not sure that the public conscience of ten years ago was not keener than it was now. There had been improvement on the whole beyond all question, but the improvement was very much like the advance of waves on the shore. They bad waves coming for- ward and going back, though in the long run the tide came fully iu, and he hoped it would be so in this case. (Cheers.) At any rate, he did not know what they could do better than encourage classes such as those they had there that night, and lay the foundation for a still further advance of knowledge. He did hope that the time was not far distant when thev would see the colieffs at Cardiff full of young students. (Applause.) To bring that about they must offer special prizes and scholarship to be gained by the poor. They all recognised the immense difficulties with which the poor bad to struggle. He alluded to the disposition which had been made ot the Wells Charity, and he for one thought a better application could not be made ot tile funds. All minds, however, were not agreed on this subject. He himself did not see, unless they applied the large endowments to the pooier classes to assist them at higher schools and at colleges, how they were to manage. He remembered when they were makiug inquiries into the state of education in Wales there was hardly a witness who did not approve of the propriety of endowments, or the larger portion of them, going to assist the children of poor men. That was what the commissioners bad tried to do with Wells' Charity, and, as he hoped and trusted, what would be done by other charities not yet dealt with. Among the working classes, who were in such enormous numerical superiority to the rest of the classes, there must be a very great number of superior minds; and not for their benefit aloi < but for the benefit of the whole community, they ought to do all they could to tiring them forward.

Morris took the chair at the annual prize distribution at the Rhon- dda County Council, the audience was not a very large one. The elements appeared to have conspired against the gathering. Considering the weather, however, the gathering was a representative one. The first item was a pianofoote solo (Schubert) by Miss Gwennie M. Samuel (a pupil of Mr. D. Jones, M.I.S.M.). Dr. Morris, in his opening speech, said he was very pleased to occupy the chair in such a meeting. There was no part of the principality more desirous of good edu- cation than the Rhondda. He was pleased as were all the governors at the parents sending their children so regularly to school. He hoped they would keep them there. Mr. Samuel, headmaster, gave his re- port. He drew attention to the increased number of pupils. During the first, and second terms of the last year there were 215 attending the school during the third term 207, and during the last term 241. The girls outnumbered the boys by three. One of the features of the last year was that there had been seven pupils studying beyond the matriculation course. Of these, one had to leave the remaining six gained the highest honour of the Welsh Central Board the certificate. Greater attention had been paid and was being paid to conversational French. The staff had been increased by two one assistant-mas- ter and one assistant-mistress. They had now a staff of ten regularly at work. There were in addition to these, six visiting teachers, and they had nearly completed the appointment of an assistant science master. A large gymnasium and manual room had been added. This school was now one of the largest in the Principality, and it was hoped to soon make it the best equipped school. During the last year twenty entrance scholarships had been offered, eleven for boys, and nine for girls, and twenty had also been competed for by pupils already in the school. For the 20 entrance scholarships there were 174 candidates, a record competition for Gla- morganshire. To the success of the school the staff had all contributed much. (Hear, hear.) The Junior School Choir, under Mr. Tom Price, and accompanied by Mr. D. Jones, gave a rendering of \"Excelsior\" (Balfe).

At a meeting of the Local Governing Body of the School on Monday, it was resolved to establish a special class for Commercial Work, with a view to helping those boys and a iris who may only be able to spend a year or two at school previous to entering an office or place of business. The Governors believe that, in forming this class the school will .benefit a number of boys and girls whose parents desire they should become clerks, etc., in the town. It is hoped that this arrangement will be of value to the Community generally, as busi- ness even will thus be provided with more efficient assistants. Mr Owen Jones, for three years a student at Pitman's Metropolitan School, with large experience in office work, and much success as a teacher of commercial subjects, has been appointed Visiting Master for Book-keeping, Shorthand, and Office Work.",

Experts stated that it was an excellent foundation for general linguistic training, and it was no impediment therefore that a child was Welsh. He further exhorted the majority of the pupils who had not received prizes not to be disheartened, and not to think that the prizes of life would of necessity be gained by those only who won prizes at school. (Cheers.) After Mr. Abraham had distributed the prizes, an old pupil of the school, in the person of Mr. Arthur Mansel Edwards, A.T.P.M., gave a ren- dering of Romance et Bolero on the violin in a praiseworthy manner. Councillor E. H. Davies, J.P. a member of the Govern- ing Body, was next called upon to address the meeting. He was glad of the oppor- tunity to witness the prize distribution. He felt pleased as a governor, and as a parent, with the high discipline and high order of the school. He was proud to find that his boy had: received a prize, thanks to the worthy efforts of the principal and teachers.

Lord preided on Thursday at the distribution of prizes of tho boys' depart-rent of the Newport Intermediate Schools. His lordship spoke very encouragingly of the esults of the schools generally.\u2014Mr. T. W. Phillips, the headmaster, quoted an extract from tlw inspector's report approving of the lines on which the schools were conducted. At pre,ent there were 154 boys in the schools, a result, very favourable when the disastrous effect of the recent strike was considered. Daring the three preceding terms there had hee.i respectively 144, 141, and 143 pupils in atten- dance.\u2014In an address delivered by the Rev. M. 0. Glal.obrodle, M.A., headmaster of Clifton Col- lege, he compared :he progress of the school and-ton n of Newliort with the chief school and town of Manchester. The fame of thoso well- known ,chcols was established by the succe:s of boys whr) entered them about the alCe of 15 and remained there for a. lonir period. The ch'cf use of intermediate schools was not in inere.ivng tho number of university graduates, but ;n raising the standard and criterion of citizenship by making citizens of advanced intellect. Another greit 1) ower of the school was the inculcating of fi'ie manners. In con- cluding. he expressed his gratification at seeing the girlj and boys' schools so close together, because ho would like to see among boys and girls the frankness ot the family and the cour- tc.-Y of outside. He had remarked the good effect of social intercourse, more especially in American society, and urged the boys to remem- ber that each girl vms somebody's sister. Piiies.\u2014Form 1.: Form, 1*. T.

SALE OF GARTHGWYNION ESTATE. The freehold residential and agricultural estate known as Garthgwynion on the borders of Montgomeryshire and Cardiganshire, in the lovely Llyfnant Valley, was offered for sale on Wednesday afternoon at the Wynn- stay Hotel, Machynlleth. The estate, which is situated close to the Dovey Estuary, about three miles from Machynlleth and seventeen miles from Aberystwyth, comprises an area of upwards of 1,200 acres and includes an ivy-clad family residence of moderate dimen- sions, a secondary residence known as Caer- aer, eight mixed- farms and small holdings, and a number of cottages. It is also abund- antly timbered, possesses excellent sporting qualifications, and includes the most inter- esting setction of Llyfnant Vailey. Mr. David Gillart (of Messrs Gillart and Sons, auctioneers, Machynlleth; conducted the sale and Mr. Crosskey, Birmingham, was present as solicitor on behalf of the trustees of the late Sir Henry Wiggin. vendors. There was a very large attendance. In opening the sale, the Auctioneer said \u2014It is seldom indeed that an auctioneer has to offer for sale a propertv possessing such attractions as the one which 1 have now the privilege of introducing to your notice. It is not necessary for me to try and describe the Garthgwynion property in detail, and I shail not attempt to do that, but I am sure that most, if not all of you who are here this afternoon are sufficiently well acquainted with the property to fully appreciate its num- erous attractive features. As to the situa- tion, it can be honestly said that this is really splendid. The estate forms practically the entire northern side of the Llyfhant Valley which is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful spots in Wales. The disposition of the estate, too, lsextremely advantageous. Instead of the holdings being divided and scattered ovea a large area, as we sometimes find, this estate lies well together, forming a compact wedge, as it were, with well-defined boundaries. I need not tell you that this is in many respects an important consideration. The majority of the holdings making up the estate are well timbered, and in some cases the value of such timoer is very considerable. Therfe are also some rTildvang young planta- tions which promise to turn 'out well. All timber will be included in the purchase price. The sporting on the estate as a whole is a prominent feature. There is no doubt that the shooting is quite one of the very best in the district. Altogether this is such a charm- ing residential property that it would be the moat natura th\u00edITV to offer it for sale in the first instance as one lot. The farms are some of the most useful in eur neighbour- hood\u2014good mixed farms, most c\\ them fur- nishing capital pasturage and with a fair proportion of arable. All the lands, broadly speaking, have a sunny aspect and are in good condition, being also well supplied with water. In most oases there is an ample supply of timber for purposes of repair. estate was then offered in one lot and bidding commenced at \u00a39,000, but rose by bids of \u00a3100 to \u00a310,300. The Auctioneer ex- plained that the annual income of the estate was \u00a3486 and the outgoings amounted to \u00a39 only. The principal bidders were Mr. Rider, Leek, Staffordshire, and Mr. Owen Owen, draper, Liverpool. Eventually, the whole estate was knocked down to the latter at JSlOjSOO amid cheers.",

It had been arranged to hold the meeting in Siloa HaJJ. but that build- ing proved far too small for the huge crowd that had assembled, and the permission of the deacons to remove to Siloa Chapel having been ob- tained, the meeting was held there, the huge edifice being full. An in- teresting feature of this prize day was the presence of Mr. \\Y. Jenkyn Thomas, M.A.. headmaster of the Hackney Down School, London I formerly headmaster of the Aber- dare County .School, and Mrs. Jenkyn Thomas. Councillor L N Williams, J.P., presided. There were also present on the platform Mrs. Walter Lloyd, Mrs. J. Griffiths, Mrs. Evan Williams, Mrs. T. Rotting, County Councillor G. A. Treharne, and Councillor A. P. Jones, members of the governing body; Miss Cook, M.A., headmistress of the Girls' School Mr. and Mrs. W. Charlton Cox, Mr. W. Uthr Williams, M.A., headmaster Mountain Ash County School, and Mrs. Williams, Mrs. (Dr.) Finney, and Mr. J. D. Thomas, clerk to the Governors. The Chairman, in his opening ad- dress. remarked that the past year had been an eventful one in the his tory. of the school. He referred to the regretted death of Alderman D. Hughes, chairman of the Governors, and also to the opening of the Girls' School. He was glad to note that that school, under the able super- vision of Miss Cook, was making splendid progress. He was glad to see present on the same platform. Mr. Jenkyn Thomas, former head- master\u2014with Mrs. Thomas\u2014Mr. W. C. Cox, the present headmaster, and Miss Cook, the new headmistress. He hoped that they would have a better financial support from the County Council in future. Just now they were receiving X400 less to- wards the two schools than they re- ceived previously towards one. He hoped that the public of Aberdare would join in the effort to bring home to the proper authorities the gravity of the situation caused by this de- privation of funds. (Applause.) The next item was a chorus; Vik- ing Song,\" by the Girls' Choir, con- ducted by Mr. Tom Price. Miss Irene Jones accompanied. Afterwards Mr. W. Charlton Cox, M.A.. headmaster, presented the seventeenth annual report of the school. He was very pleased to wel- come to Aberdare the former head- master and his wife, and he hoped that they would be able to show Mr. Thomas that the school was main- taining its reputation. He also wished to join in the regrets ex- pressed at the departure of the late Alderman D. Hughes. The Boys' Choir, conducted by Councillor Ogwen Williams, now sang a series of Welsh Airs. Thereupon the prizes and certifi- cates were distributed by Mrs. W. Jenkyn Thomas. The Girls' Choir now sang. Mr. W. Jenkyn Thomas, who was well received, said that for nine happy years he acted as headmaster of the Aberdare County School, and during eight of these years he was assisted by the lady who had just gone through the task of distributing prizes. It gave him a great pleasure indeed to renew old acquaintance with teachers, governors and old pupils, and also to see the present pupils. He wished to congratulate Mr. Cox and his staff on the very excellent results of the year. He knew the value of a school report, and could say that this was a very fine report, one which he envied indeed. He was glad to see that Mr. Cox had succeeded in carrying through certain improvements which he (the speaker) had desired to see. To the pupils he would say Work hard, play hard and always be abso- lutely straight.\" Turning to the governing body Mr. Thomas asked them not to neglect the boys' school now that they had a fine palace as girls' school. Two ribs had been taken out of the old school, one by Mountain Ash and one by the new girls' school. Even Adam had to suffer through .being deprived of a rib, and the school, after undergoing this surgical operation, should be well nourished. He would advise them. for the sake of the efficiency of the schools, while paying due at- tention to the buildings, to give also to the teachers their dues in the matter of salaries. Addressing the parents the speaker said that if they wanted to reap the full benefit of secondary education they must keep the children in school longer than they did at present. He deprecated the great rush for Civil Service ap- pointments, advertisements of which lured so many youths. He did not know whether lr. Cox was troubled so much by these as he was. Com- ing to the past students Mr. Thomas remarked that he was glad that the Past Students' Association was in a prosperous condition. They had a flourishing branch of it in London. He was looking forward to a time when there would be a club house of old students in Victoria Square. He wished every success to the old and new schools. (Applause.) After a chorus by the Boys' Choir, \"Casabianca.\" Miss Cook gave a brief address. She remarked that inasmuch as she had no official exist- ence last vear, they could hardly ex- pect an \"address from her. She would like to say, however, that the rib was quite happy in its domicile in Cwmbach-road. There was not even a sign of boredom. There were 147 pupils enrolled, and the school had been built to accommodate 150. One pleasant function at this school was the parents' visiting day. tn- fortunately it had' been somewhat marred by the very wet weather that day. They all regretted the depar- ture from the school of Miss Morris, one of the mistresses. Work was going on very well there, but play not so well, owing to lack of proper facilities. She wished to give her heartiest thanks to the governors, the parents, and to the girls, and all who assisted her in \"her duties (Applause.) Councillor A. P. Jones moved a vote of thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Jen- kyn Thomas. He would suggest that they place the management of the Cwmbach School entirely in the hands of ladies. Mrs. J. Griffiths seconded the vote of thanks. She was pleased to see London agreeing so well with Mr. and Mrs. Jenkyn Thomas. Mrs. Walter Lloyd proposed a vote of thanks to the chairman. She wished to assure the gentlemen that they would be welcomed at the Cwm- bach-road School. Mr. G. A. Treharne briefly second- ed the vote of thanks. Mr. T. Eynon Davies. B.Sc.. speak- ing on behalf of the old students, gave a cordial welcome to Mr. and Mrs. Jenkyn Thomas. Mr. E. J. Hughes, solicitor, endorsed the words of welcome. Prizes Awarded by the Governors.

The annual distribution of prizes at St. David's College School, Lampeter, took place on Wednes- day atternoon in the presence of a large attendance. Principal Bebb presided and was supported on the platform by Mrs Inglis Jones, Derry Ormond Mr Darlington, Aberystwyth Mr W. L1. Footman (headmaster), Dr Walker (mayor), the College pro- fessorial staff, and the school staff. Among those who were also present were Ladv Hills-Johnes, Dolaucothi; Colonel and Mrs Davies-Evans, High- mead Mrs Robert Williams Mr and Mrs Jones, Brittania Stores the Rev and Mrs J. D. Lewis, Pencarreg Mrs Fowden the Rev and Mrs D. Jones, The Vicarage; Mrs Davies, Cambrian Factory Miss Evans, Taliesin House Mrs Jones, Peterwell; Mrs Jones, Old Bank Misses Davies, Gwynfryn Mrs Lloyd, Derry Ormond Mr and Mrs J. Ernest Lloyd; Mr and Mrs Nun Davies; Mr Roderick Evans Mrs Jones, Railway Hotel, Llan-1 ybyther and Mrs Jones, Mill Bank. Principal BEBB, in his opening remaiks, said they were present to congratulate the school on its success and to encourajfe those who had been successful in getting prizes. There was very little to say in regard to the school. It had no history further than going on its way and doing its work conscientiously and satisfactorily. From his know- ledge of the staff, he thought the parents were to be congiatulated in sending their children to the school. They would see from the Headmaster's report that no side of education had been neglected. The intellectual side was obviously looked after, but the study of the laws of nature was also regarded. In regard to the important subject of consumption, a great deal had beenjdone in warding it off if the rising generation would benefit from the study. They were grateful to Mrs Davies-Evans, who had taken so much interest in the branch,land bad given several prizes to encourage the boys. Physical drill, which was 2an increasingly important side of education, was also indulged in. He wished to publicly thank Dr Griffiths, who had kindly examined tha boys, and in conclusion he, referred to the number of exhibitions which had been given during the year by Mrs Fowden, Mrs Waddingham, and others. The Headmaster then read his report. He said that after his first oomplete year as headmaster, he was decidedly satisfied on the way the boys had acquitted themselves, the results testifying to the thoroughness of the training. The laboratory had been furnished with additional materials o facilitate the study of science, and the library had received a large addition of books, and the scholar- ships materiaUy augmented. Special scholarships were given by Mr Harford, Mr Inglis Jones, Mr Waddingham, Mrs Lloyd, The Bryn, The Old Bank, Mr J. E. Rogers, Abermeurig, the late Mr Hughes, Neuaddfawr, the Principal, the Mayor of Lampeter, and Mrs Fowden. Honest endeavours had been made to provide the boys with opportunities for physicai training in well-organized athletics, in regular military drill, in cross-country runs, while their minds were prepared for proper physical care cf the body by regular lectures in hygiene, Dr Griffiths assisting. The prizes awarded for hygiene were given by Mrs Davies. Evans. He wished the boys could have musical culture. It had been his endeavour to have the boys under supervision outside the school walls; to teach them that by their conduct towards others would the school be judged to instil in them the principles of right behaviour to be, in fine, Christian gentlemen. The report of the examiner. Mr G. S. Whicker, M.A., on behalf of the Oxford Delegacy, was appended, which stated that in general the work was up to a good average and the boys were well together. The successes during the year in the South Ken- sington examination included four boys in the first stage of practical ohemistry, six in theoretical chemistry, fonr in mathematics, and one in advanced mechanics. The follow- ing were the successes in Oxford local Seniors \u2014David Davies, religious knowledge, Greek, with distinction in advanced mathematics D D Evans, religious knowledge, English literature, Latin, and mathematics F A Jones, religious knowledge, English literature, Latin, and Greek D J Davies, religious knowledge, English litera- ture, Latin, and mathematics.

Hygiene prizes (given by Mrs Davies-Evans, Highmead). Form VI. David Davies senior division, F W Stephens and Cyril Lewis junior division, E W Davies. Cricket- batting, Tom Williams bowling, Cyril Lewis. Dr E. H. Griffiths sent in a report stating that as the importance of hygiene was beginning to be recognised) and was* attracting the serious atten- tion of the general public, it gave him great pleasure to examine the papers set on the subj acts to various forms of the School. The class in hygiene was divided into three forms\u2014sixth, senior and junior forms. In tha firmer .D Davies stood alone and ,took the prize. The general excellence of the work done in the senior form was very favourable. F Stephens took the first prize and Cyril Lewis (three marks lower) took the second. These two boys would not have disgraced them- selves in the race with D Davies. The names of E L Davies, Basil Morgan, 'and George Davies also deserved honourable mention. In the junior form E W Davies won the prize, and in future would render a good account of himself. The intelligence evinced in the work of the pupils showed a grasp and love of the subject, and re- flected credit and thoroughness on the part of the teacher. Dr Griffiths wished, however, to im. press upon the class as a whole that while it was praiseworthy to be able to describe how ventilation was carried out by Sherringham valves and Tobin tubes, ventilation in ordinary dwelling house, to be effective, must be carried out by the means of the free chimney and open windows. In the un- avoidable absence of Dr Griffiths, the report was read by the Headmaster. After the distribution of prizes had been gracefully performed by Mrs Inglis Jones, the Chairman called on Mr Darlington to speak. Mr Darlington said he felt rather em- barassed when asked to speak about secondary education as he had ceased his connection with it ten years ago. A casual remark dropped by the Headmaster would be the text of his brief address. He had asked him how many boys under his care in the school had been through an elementary school, and he was surprised to find that there was a percentage of ninety-nine, which was a considerable pro- portion. This was of personal interest to him, as he had beea watching them passing through the primary schools. The fact was also interesting from a wider consideration\u2014the difference between English and Welsh systems. He would not deprecate English education as a whole-for he owed much to the public school system, which was the finest manifestation of British educational ideas, and he recognised that it was the repository and trustee of some of the finest national traditions. At the same time, he felt that there was much truth in the criticism of Continental friends that the system, while yielding to none in some respects, was too aristocratic; while it undoubtedly suc- ceeded in training the governing classes, the best things in English education were, nevertheless, for the few and not for the many. There was no such impassable gulf between primary and secondary education in Wales, and our school system ex. emplified the tradition of Welsh national life. Men of culture were not the exclusive few, and education was as much in the home of the peasant as in the manse. He was glad to gather from the list of successes that the curriculum which was pursued at the school emrbaced such subjects as Latin and Greek on one hand and physical culture on the other. At the present stage of education, it was idle to deny that it should aim at the harmonious development of every side of mental, moral, and physical activity the exclusive pre- dominance of classics in education bad been broken through by the claims of physical science and modern languages. His personal opinion was that the future of secondary education abaslutely re- quired as a condition of its success that its basis should be mentally humanistic. Its supreme object was to exhort the moral aspects of instruc- tion, for such subjects as history, language, and literature had to do with man. They should not, however, exclude science and classics from the schools, for they were necessary parts of mental training. In conclusion, Mr Darlington said he was glad to see the school succeeding so well under the present headmaster, whom he knew at Aberyst. wyth and that his reputation had been fully re- tained in his new position. Professor WALKER proposed a vote of thanks to Mrs Inglis Jones. In seconding the proposition, Principal BEBB made the announcement that Lord Tredegar had contributed 9500 to the funds of the College. Mrs INGLIS JONES suitably responded and the meeting separated.",

The annual distribution of prizes at St. David's College School, Lampeter, took place on Wednes- day afternoon in the presence of a large attendance. Principal Bebb presided and was supported on the platform by Mrs Inglis Jones, Derry Ormond Mr Darlington, Aberystwyth Mr W. LI. Footman (headmaster), Dr Walker (mayor), the College pro- fessorial staff, and the school staff. Among those who were also present were Lady Hills-Johnes, Dolaucothi CQlonel and Mrs Davies-Evans, High- mead Mrs Robert Williams Mr and Mrs Jones, Brittauia Stores the Rev and Mrs J. D. Lewis, Pencarreg Mrs Fowden the Rev and Mrs D. Jones, The Vicarage; Mrs Davies, Cambrian Factory Miss Evans, Taliesin House Mrs Jones, Peterweil; Mrs Jones, Old Bank Misses Davies, Gwynfryn Mra Lloyd, Derry Ormond Mr and Mrs J. Ernest Lloyd; Mr and Mrs Nun Davies; Mr Roderick Evans Mrs Jones, Railway Hotel, Lian- ybyther and Mrs Jones, Mill Bank. Principal BEBB, in his opening remaiks, said they were present to congratulate the school on its success and to encourage those who had been successful in getting prizes. There was very little to say in regard to the school. It had no history further than going on its way and doing its work conscientiously and satisfactorily. From his know-! ledge of the staff, he thought the parents were to >e cougiatulated in sending their children to the chool. They would see from the Headmaster's 'eport that no side of education had been neglected. [he intellectual side was obviously looked aftar, )ut the study of the laws of nature was also egarded. In regard to the important subject of jonsumption, a great deal had been;done in warding .t off if the rising generation would benefit from the study. They were grateful to Mrs Davies-Evans, who had taken so much interest in the branch,land lad given several prizes to encourage the boys. Physical drill, which was -an increasingly important side of education, was also indulged in. He wished to publicly thank Dr Griffiths, who had kindly examined th3 boys, and in conclusion he referred to the number of exhibitions which had been given during the year by Mrs Fowden, Mrs Waddingham, and others. The Headmaster then read his report. He s-,id that after his first complete year as headmaster, he was decidedly satisfied on the way the boys had acquitted themselves, the results testifying to the thoroughness of the training. The laboratory had been furnished with additional materials to facilitate the study of science, and the library had received a large addition oi books, and the scholar- ships materially augmented. Special scholarships were given by Mr Harford, Mr Inglis Jones, Mr Waddingham, Mrs Lloyd, The Bryn, The Old Bank, Mr J. E. Rogers, Abermeurig, the late Mr Hughes, Neuaddfawr, the Principal, the Mayor of Lampeter, and Mrs Fowden. Honest endeavours had been made to provide the boys with opportunities for physicai training in well-organized athletics, in regular military drill, in cross-country runs, while their minds were prepared for proper physical care cf the body by regular lectures in hygiene. Dr Griffiths assisting. The prizes awarded for hygiene were given by Mrs Davies- Evans. He wished the boys could have musical culture. It had been his endeavour to have the boys under supervision outside the school walls to teach them that by their conduct towards others would the school be judged to instil in them the principles of right behaviour to be, in fine, Christian gentlemen. The report of the examiner, Mr G. S. Whicker, M.A., on behalf of the Oxford Delegacy, was appended, which stated that in general the work was up to a good average and the boys were well together. The successes during the year in the South Ken- sington examination included four boys in the first stage of practical chemistry, six in theoretical chemistry, four in mathematics, and one in advanced mechanics. The follow- ing were the successes in Oxford local :\u2014Seniors \u2014David Davies, religious knowledge, Greek, with distinction in advanced mathematics D D Evans, religious knowledge, English literature, Latin, and mathematics F A Jones, religious knowledge, English literature, Latin, and Greek D J Davies, religious knowledge, English litera- ture, Latin, and mathematics.

Hygienp prizB (given by Mrs Davies-Evans, Highmead). Form VI. David Davies senior division, F W Stephens and Cyril Lewis junior division, E W Davies. Cricket\u2014 batting, Tom Williams bowling, Cyril Lewis. Dr E. H. Griffiths sent in a report stating that as the importance of hygiene was beginning to be recognisedj and was' attracting the serious atten- tion of the general public, it gave him great pleasure to examine the papers set on the subjects to various forms of the School. The clabe in hygiene was divided into three forms-sixth, senior and junior forms. In the farmer .D Davies stood alone and .took the prize. The general excellence of the work done in the senior form was very favourable. F Stephens took the first prize and Cyril Lewis (three marks lower) took the second. These two boys would not have disgraced them- selves in the race with D Davies. The names of E L Davies, Basil Morgan, and George Davies also deserved honourable mention. In the junior form E W Davies won the prize, and in future would render a good account of himself. The intelligence evinced in the work of the pupils showed a grasp and love of the subject, and re- flected credit and thoroughness on the part of the teacher. Dr Griffiths wished, however, to im press upon the class as a whole that while it was, praiseworthy to be able to describe how ventilation was carried out by Sherringham valves and Tobin tubes, ventilation in ordinary dwelling house, to be effective, must be carried out by the means of the free chimney and open windows. In the un- avoidable absence of Dr Griffiths, the report was read by the Headmaster. After the distribution of prizes had been gracefully performed by Mrs Inglis Jones, the Chairman called on Mr Darlington to speak. Mr Darlington said he felt rather em- barassed when asked to speak about secondary education as he had ceased his connection with it ten years ago. A casual remark dropped ty the Headmaster would be the text of his brief address. He had asked him how many boya under his care in the school had been through an elementary school, and he was surprised to find that there was a percentage of ninety-nine, which was a considerable pro- portion. This was of personal interest to him, as he had been watching them passing through the primary schools. The fact was also interesting from a wider consideration\u2014the difference between English and Welsh systems. He would not deprecate English education as a whole-for he owed much to the public school system, which was the finest manifestation of British educational ideas, and he recognised that it was the repository and trustee of some of the finest national traditions. At the same time, he felt that there was much truth in the criticism of Continental friends that the system, while yielding to none in some respects, was too aristocratic while it undoubtedly suc- ceeded in training the governing classes, the best things in English education were, nevertheless, for the few and not for the many. There was no such impassable gulf between primary and secondary education in Wales, and our school system ex. emplified the tradition of Welsh national life. Men of culture were not the exclusive few, and education was as much in the home of the peasant as in the manse. He was glad to gather from the list of successes thwt the curricalum which was pursued at the school emrbaced such subjects as Latin and Greek on one hand and physical culture on the other. At the present stage of education, it was idle to deny that it should aim at the harmonious development of every eide of mental, moral, and physical activity the exclusive pre- dominance of classics in education had been broken through by the claims of physical science and modern languages. His personal opinion was that the future of secondary education absolutely re- quired as a condition of its success that its basis should be mentally humanistic. Its supreme object was to exhort the moral aspeets of instruc- tion, for such subjects as history, language, and literature had to do with man. They should not, however, exclude science and classics from the schools, for they were necessary parts of mental training. In conclusion, Mr Darlington said he was glad to see the school succeeding so well under the present headmaster, whom he knew at Aberyst wyth and that his reputation had been fully re- tained in his new position. Professor WALKER proposed a vote of thanks to Mrs Inglis Jones. In seconding the proposition, Principal BEBB made the announcement that Lord Tredegar had contributed 9500 to the funds of the College. Mrs INGLIS JONES suitably responded and the meeting spparated.",

On Monday evening Madame Clara Novello Davies had an exciting experience between Rhyl and Llandudno. The Royal Welsh Ladies' Choir had been engaged to perform at Llandudno Pier concerts, but Mrs Davies and three lady friends missed their train at Rhyl, and then hired a motor car to convey them to their destination. Unfortunately their troubles were not over, for a puncture stopped further progress when about half way. During the re- pair of this by the chauffeur four tramps arrived on the scene and demanded money from the party, and assumed a very threatening attitude. The timely arrival of two cyclists made the tramps quickly clear off. The repairing of the tyre was then completed, but the popular lady conductor did not arrive at the Pavilion until the concert had been in progress a short time. SATURDAY'S FOOTBALL.

HAHPEn. <: lilvc received the following important letter from Dr. II, D. Harper, Principal of Jesus College, Oxford, whose name is so intimately associated with higher education in Walts:\u2014 \".H the I.lnndovery School PriAvd.-iv on July Harpur, I took the oppor- tunity of drawing attention to tho fact that four of the Welsh Schools had been placed by their governing bodies undor the Oxford and Cambridge Schools Examination U')llrd, and I pointed out. the advantages whi('h \u00f81'\u00cd.o frun a school 'x-irig submitted in that way to an ex- traneous \"ml authoritative examination, which affords also a rough general comparison of its teaching with that of other schools of the country. The mode by which the comparison is arrived at is as followsTh-j universities which conduct the examinations offer certificates of merit to lIch candidates as reach certain standards of attain- ment, and grant distinctions to such of them as exhibit niarlied proficiency. The ortlinary I pus, standard is somewhat above that for Responsions itt Oxford. The standard for Distinction is pro- bably that toranopen scholarship at a good college, so that the honour of distinction is a real one. Some fifty or sixty schools have been exan)inod this year by the board, including some of the most important public scnools of England, as well as B \"econ, Cowbridgo, Llandovery, and Swansea Schools, and 734 boys were presented as candidates for certificates, Tho results wore published on Saturday week, and I ask your insertion of a few notes upon them, ns highly interesting to all who are concerned in the promotion of higher educa- tion in Wale. \"Tho statistics Show that of tho 734 candidates 384 obtained certilicatcs as having satisfied the examiners in four subjects at least. Of these 9 came from Christ College, Brecon; 1 from Cow- bridge, 8 from Llandovery, and 2 from Swansea. The head boy at Llandovery was unfortunately absent through illness, or an additional certificate would, doubtless, have been credited to that school. \"Of the Brecon candidates, 11 passed in Latin, 10 in Greek, 9 in elementary mathematics, 3 in higher mathematics, one of them with distinction; 7 in history, and no fewer than four of them with distinction, and 12 in Scripture knowledge. \"The Cowbridgo candidate satisfied the exami- ners iu Latin, Greek,elementary mathematics, and Scripture knowlodge. \"Of the Llandovery candidates 12 paged in Latin; 13 in Greek; 16 in elementary rnatite- matics 3 in higher mathematics, and all of them with distinction; 7 in history, one being dis- tinguished; 10 in Scripture knowledge; 2 in natural science, mechanical division; 2 in chemistry, one of them with distinction. \"Of the Swansea candidates 3 satisfied the examiners in Latin, ono being distinguished; 2 in Greek: 2 in elementary mathematics; 2 in higher mathematics, both boing distinguished; 3 in Scripture knowledge. The four Welsh schools are, therefore, repre- sented by 27 1 passes' in Latfo out of a total number of 491; 26 in Greek out of 468; 28 in elementary mathematics out of 444; 8 in higher mathematics out of 208; 26 in Scripture know- ledge out of 483; 14 in history from Brecon and Llandovery out of 344; 2 from Llandovery in mechanics out of 18; and 2 also from Llandovery in chemistry out of 23. In distinctions, 1 boy from Swansea is distin- guished in Latin out of a total of 51 boys distin- guished in that subject; 6 boys from Welsh schools are distinguished in mathematics out of a total of 40, and 5 in history out of 42; and ono boy from Llandovery is distinguished in chemistry out of a total of O. The distinctions in mathematics and history are above tha average number to be ox- pected. \"Had only selected boys been sent up for certi- ficates tho evidenco afforded of the condition of the schools generally would be worthless, but the whole sixth forms were sent up from Brocon alld Llandovery, and the large number of boys who satisfy tho examiners in each subject affords un- deniable evidence of ths goodness of tho teaching throughout. Thefactthat. 14 boys from Brc<'oll I' and Llandovery pass in history, and 5 of them with distinction, is especially significant, for that! honour implies good and fluent English cotnposi-1 lion, as well as historical knowledge. The two boys also from Swansea have received and been able to profit by good teaching. I heartily con- gratulale both the masters and the boys upon the position occupied by their schools I it t'li published I lists. \"I do not know any schools In England at which teaching of the same character and quality can be obtained at as little cost as at Brecon and Llandovery. This is a great boast for them; but 1 fear that the teaching is given at less than cost price, and that the reputation of the school* is being maintained by the self-sacrifice of head- masters, who are contented to find their sole reward in the good work they are doing, 1 liavo the best reason for knowing that the total income from endowment and tultiou fees is inadequate for the proper remuneration of even the assistant musters.\"",

On Wednesday, the annual distribution of prizes at Portmadoc County School took place at the Portmadoc Town Hall. In the absence of Mr Wm. George, Dr Samuel Griffith, J.P., took the chair. HEADMASTER'S REPORT. Mr J. Rhys Evans, M.A., the headmaster, in his report, said that the number of pupils in the school was 112 \u2014 the largest on record. Of these, 12 wore pupil teachers. Mr Wm. Jones, M.A., had been added to the staff during the year. The Old Pupils' Associa,t,ion had decided to award an entramce scholarship to pupils entering from elementary schools. In one school in North Wales, three members of the staff were old pupils of Portmadoc. Tom Roberts, another old pupil, won the Cyn- ddelw Scholarship and the T. E. Ellis Prize at the Aberystwyth College. The number of certificates gained at the Central Welsh Board examinations, 1905, were: Honours, 3; senior, 4; junior, 12. In all. 33 dis- tinctions were obtained. It must be re- membered, however, in estimating the value of this result, that three years ago there were but 57 pupils in school. Other successes included two county exhibitions ( \u00a3 20 for 3 years), entrance scholarship ( \u00a3 15 for 3 years), at Aberystwyth College (first division), London matriculation (first divi- scn). and Welsh matriculation (first divi- sion). During the year the school had been visited by six,inspe-etors and two examiners, surely an excessive number, suggesting that some of the money thus expended should be devoted to better purposes in equipping the schools. The following were the prize-winners:\u2014 Form V. (a), T. H. P. Williams, E. Hamblin; (b), W. A. Jones, R. Lloyd George. Form IV.: R. Jones, M. MeKerrow. N. Griffith, J. Williams. Form III.

The Chairman congratulated those who had won prizes. They began well, and he hoped they would continue to succeed during th rest of their lives. They should never shirk examinations. He sympathised with those who had not received prizes. They should exert their efforts and try again. The Headmaster referred to the death of Dr W. Jones Morris, one of the heartiest supporters of the school from the beginning. The prizes were distributed by Miss Pughe Jones, Ynysgain, Criccieth, who also gave a gracious and encouraging address. THE TEACHING OF WELSH. Mr J. H. Davies, Cwrtmawr, Aberystwyth, was then called upon for a speech. He wits conversant, he said, with the reports of the county schools, and he sould say that the Portmadoc County School was one of the best in the country (cheers). When the ques- tion of teaching. Welsh in the schools came to the front, the teachers said that it inter- fered with the teaching of other subjects. A committee was appointed to prepare a re- port on the question, and it was discovered that the schools that had passed highest in languages were thoee where Welsh had been taught (loud cheers). This was the result of the sensible method of using in the schools the language that the pupils knew. As one who was in touch with the education move- ment at Aberystwyth, lie was glad to be able to say that one of the best students at the college there was a. Portmadoc man, Tom Roberts (loud applause). He had been elected by the students to an, important position there Mr Davies said that he would not be sur- ) prised if Tom Roberts would come out with double honours at his final examination. Another Portmadoc man was third or fourth on the list in the college. When it was con- sidered that the very best scholars of the country were sent to Aberystwyth, the posi- tion of the young Portmadoc scholar was very creditable. Portmadoc school was con- sidered by Aberystwyth people as an excel- Lent one. The headmaster had referred to the interferenc of the work of a school by fre- quent inspection. That might be true. But 1 they should bear in mind that the system was an experimental one. There was no an- tagonism in the Central Board to the head- masters. The Boord would willingly accept a. system that would be superior to the pre- sent one. He himself would give to a suc- cessful schoolmaster every liberty to carry on his duties in his own way, and he would allow such a school to pass without examina- tion (cheers). What a. difference there was between modern schools and those of 60 or 80 yars ago I He instanced the school kept j .by \"Little John Jones, of Llangeitho, Hii.vdly a, bench in the school had a leg, and the floor was of hare earth. Yet from that school, with all ii-i defects, such men as Dr Lewis Edwards, Uala: Rev John Phillips, J Bftngor- Rev He-.ry Richard and Dr Wil- liam Rowlands, America, rose,-all eminent men in Welsh history. Teachers should be enthusiastic. A question hrul been asked what was to be done with the graduates when they left college? He found that very few of the graduate* ever thought of pre- paring themselves for any special avocation, with the result that they turned towards the teaching profeesioa after completing their college training. There r-ere many openings for the- graduates, if they only thought of them,\u2014the Indian and other branches of the Civil Service. The training for the Welsh degre*- was very elastic, and students could be. prepared for the legal rind medical pro-",

On Wednesday, the annual distribution of prizes at Portmadoc County School took place at the Portmadoc Town Hall. In the absence of Mr Wm. George, Dr Samuel Griffith, J.P., took the chair. HEADMASTER'S REPORT. Mr J. Rhys Evans, M.A.. the headmaster, in his report, said that the number of pupils, in the school was 112 \u2014 the largest on record. Of those, 12 were pupil teachers. Mr Wm. Jones, M.A., had been added to the staff during the. year. The Old Pupils' Association had decided to award aiD ent-raince scholarship to pupils entering from elementary schools. In one school in Notrth Walesi three, members of the etaff were. old: pupils of Portmadoc. Tom Roberts, another old pupil, won the Cyn- ddelw Scholarship and the T. E. Ellis Prize at the Aberystwyth College. The number of certificates gained at the Central Welsh Board examinations, 1905, were: Honours, 3; senior, 4; junior, 12. In aU, 33 dis- tincti-ons were obtained. It must be re- membered, however, in estimating the value of this result, that three years ago there. were but 57 pupils in school. Other successes included two county exhibitions (\u00a320 for 3 years), entrance scholarship ( \u00a3 15 for 3 years), nIt Aberystwyth College (first division), London matriculation (first divi- sri! and Welsh matriculation (first divi- sion). During the year the school had been, vicikjd by six,inspectors amd two examiners, surely an excessive number, suggesting that some of the money tlitus -expe-nd-ed should be devoted to better purposes in equipping the schools. The following were the prize-winners :\u2014 Form V. (a), T. H. P. Williams, E. Hamblin; (b), W. A. Jonee. R. Lloyd George. Form IV.: R. Jones, M. McKerrow, N. Griffith, J. Williams.

The Chairman congratulated those who had won prizes. They began well, and he hoped they would continue to succeed during th rest of their lives. They should never shirk examinations. He sympathised with those who had not received prizes. They should exert their efforts and try again. The Headmaster referred to the death of Dr W. Jones Morris, one of the heartiest supporters of the school from the beginning. The prizes were distributed by Miss Pughe Jones, Ynysgain, Criccieth, who also gave a. gracious and encouraging address. THE TEACHING OF WELSH. Mr J. H. Davies, Cwrtmawr, Aberystwyth, was then called upon for a. speech. He was conversant, he said, with the TeportB of the county schools, and he sould say tha.t the Portmadoc County School was one of the best in the country (cheers). When the ques- tion of teaching Welsh in the echoolB eaxae to. the front, the teachers said that it inter- fered with the teaching of other subjects. A committee waa appointed to prepare a re- port on the question, and it was discovered that the schools that had passed highest in languages were those where Welsh had been taught (loud cheers). This was the result of the sensible method of using in the schools the language that the pupils knew. As One who was in touch with the education move- ment at Aberystwyth, he was glad to be able to say that one of the best students at the college there was a Portmadoc man, Tom Roberts (loud applause). He had been elected by the students to an. important position there Mr Davies said that he would not be sur- \u2022 prised if Tom Roberts would come out with double honours at his final examination, j Another Portmadoc man was third or fourth 1 on the list in the college. When it was con- sidered that the very best scholars of the country were sent to Aberystwyth, the po<\u00bbi- j tion of the young Portmadoc echolar was very creditable. Portmadoc scjhool was con,- j sidered by Aberystwyth .people as an excel- lent one. The headmaster had referred to the j interferenc of the work of a school by fre- j quent inspection. That might be true. But; they should bear in mind that the system was an experimental one. There was no on- tagonism in the Central Board to the head. masters. The Board would willingly accept a system that would be superior to the pre- I sent one. He himself would give to a sue- cessful schoolmaster every liberty to carry on his duties in his own way, and he would allow such a school to pass without examina- tion (cheers). What a difference there was between modern schools and those of 60 or 80 yars ago! Hie instanced the school kept by \"Little John Jones, 6f Llangeitho.\" I Hardly a bench in the school had a leg, and J the floor was of bare earth. Yet from that school, with all its defects, such men as Dr | Lewis Edwards, Bala; Rev John Phillips, Bangor; Rev Henry Ric-hard and Dr Wil- liam Rowlands, America, rose,\u2014all eminent j men in W\u00abMi history. Teachers should he enthusiastic. A question had been asked what wits to be done with the graduates when they left college' lle found that very few of the graduates ever thought of pre- paring themselves for any special avocation. with the result that they turned' towards the teaching profession after completing their college training. There were many openings for the graduates, if they only thought.- of them \u2014the Indian and oilier branches of the Civil Service The tmining for the.

He did not see any prizes for music and manual training, and he hoped this would be remedied on the next occasion. (Hear, hear). In England, he was sorry to say, they had no organised system of secondary edu. oation, but in Wales the Education Act had spread throughout the length and breadth ot the land, and was doing admirable work. (Ap- plause). He would like to see more large scholarships offered and fewer small ones offered at secondary schools. He would like to see some of the small scholarships put together in order to make one large one. He wanted to see pulSic money employed in order to enable a really clever child to, climb up every step in the educational ladder without a shilling's ex- pense to his parents, and no impediment should b? placed in the way of the child for want of money. (Applause). The speaker touched upon the subject of secondary education generally,and concluded by expressing a hope that an increase in the number of scholars would not be obtained at the expense of lowering the curriculum of the Intermediate School, but rather that the number should be limited and a large number of scholarships provided. (Applause). A vote of thanks to Sir George was proposed by Miss G. Davies, Ynyshir, seconded by Mrs George Davies, Penygraig, and carried with acclamation. Other addresses were delivered, and a num- ber of sonors were rendered bv the school child- ren, couducted by Mr Tom Price.",

                "full_text": "-\u2666 CENTRAL HIGHER GRADE BOARD SCHOOL. DISTRIBUTION OF PRIZES AND CERTIFICATES. ADDRESSES BY THE REV. A. A. MATHEWS, MR. W. HOWELL, AND ALDERMAN RICHARD MARTIN. On Friday evening last, a public meeting was held in the Albert Hall, Swansea, when < the prizes and certificates gained by the suc- cessful pupils of the Central Higher Grade Board School were distributed. In the absence of Mr. Councillor David Harris, vice- Chairman of the School Board, the Rev. A. A. Mathews presided, and there were also present Alderman Richard Martin, Mr. W. S. Harris and Mr. David Roberts (members of the School Board)-, Mr. A. W. Halden (Clerk to the Board), Mr. W. Howells (one of the managers of the Higher Grade School), and Mr. S. Roberta, B.A. (head-master). The audience was larger than any that had as- sembled in the hall on previous occasions of this kind, and a better compliment could not be paid Mr. S. Roberts and Miss E. Davies (head-mistress) than that contained in the fact that in the school which they conduct with so much success there is being taken by the people a deep and increasing interest. The front of the platform had been prettily decorated, and, as in previous years, the scholars\u2014boys and girls\u2014were seated on either side of the organ. The proceedings were opened with a piano- forte solo Alice\" (Aicher), by Miss May Thomas. The choir, led by Mr. John H. Rees, one of the teachers, then gave a pleasant rendering of Hither fairies trip\"\u2014a composition by Tully well adapted to the voices of children. Miss Rachel A. Davies then sang \"Driven from Home,\" and she was followed by Master D. J. Thomas, whose sing- ing of Dr. Parry's \"Cymru Fydd, would have aroused any Welsh audience to enthusi- asm, He sang delightfully, and was loudly encored. The chairman afterwards addressed the meeting. At the outset, he regretted the absence of Dr. Morgan, and said that it would be a distinct loss to the educational world of Swansea to be deprived of such an ardent friend of education as Dr. Morgan had proved himself since he had been in this town. The speaker said a letter, regretting his inability to attend, had been received from Mr. David Harris, who. at the close of his letter, added:\u2014\" I may, however, take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the work done in the boys' department of the Central Higher Grade School during the past year, and may also state that it is the inten- tion of the Board to make the Girls' Higher Grade School an organised science school. With this object in view they have .recently appointed a highly-qualified mistress to take charge of it. So that during the next year excellent work is expected, and will, I feel sure, be secured from both departments.\" (Applause.) Letters of apology were read from Messrs. Joseph Rosser, Christopher j/ James, J. Coke Fowler, C. H. Glascodine, and Principal D. Salmon. It was pleasing to know, the chairman went on to say, that they had the sympathy of these friends of education; and he was also pleased to convey to the audience their good wishes with regard to the Higher Grade School. He was himself glad to be present to show his sympathy with the excellent work that was being done in that school, and to Evish it God-speed in the future. He congratulated the master, teachers and boys, on having at last reached their new home, and it was very gratifying to be already able to record a large increase in the number of those who attended the school. (Applause.) He found that, during the past year, nearly 100 new boys had entered the new school; and this, he thought, was a guarantee that the parents of the boys were glad that a home, worthy of their Higher Grade School, had at last been found. At present there were in the boys' department 340 boys, and 270 in the girls' department. The two departments now formed an organ- ised science sehool, which would be worked on the lines set forth in the new syllabus of the Science and Art Department. It was believed that these changes would improve the in- struction especially for girls; for, in future, less time would be devoted to science subjects, and more to literary subjects. This was not because they believed that instruction in the sciences was not important. If they were to move with the times, and occupy that prominent position among nfttjops which we have occupied in days g<?n\u00a7 bT. +hey must at- tend to the sojentii^ education of their boys. \u25a0v He was pleased to mention, with regard to the girls' department, that they had been able to appoint a new mistress in the person of Miss Phipps, B.A., of the London University, who was also to have as her lieutenant Miss Neal L.L.A., St. Andrew's University. This shewed that the members of the School Board were desirous to do everything they could to further the interests, not only of the boys, but also of the girls, in this important town; and all they asked for now was the co-operation of the parents in order that the education imparted to the children might be worthy ot the town, and bring about results that would carry gratifi- cation into the hearts of Swansea people, and those who were in charge of the schools, (Applause.) Mr. W m. Howell, a former member of the School Board, was the next to address the meeting. In the course of an interesting speech he said these schools were becoming more and more acceptable to the people. For many years a feeling prevailed that these schools were not required, and that they were not doing the sort of work which ought to ba done. At present, however, the majority of the people in this town were convinced that these schools filled the gap between the elementary and intermediate schools. There were a large number of parents in Swansea who would not be able to pay \u00a37 10s. for the education which would be given their children in the new intermediate schools; so, there- fore, he (the speaker) held that there would always be room for this school as an inter- always be room for this school as an inter- mediate one for the less wealthy part of the community. (Applause.) Another advantage claimed for higher grade and organised science schools was that the instruction was continuous with that in the elementary schools, so that when pupils passed through them to the intermediate schools, their education would be more satisfactory than when transferred from elementary schools directly to the intermediate schools. In con- clusion, Mr. Howell, stated that, from the head-master's report for last year, it appeared that one boy, Llewelyn Morgan, had earned in the way of grants, from the Science and Art Department, no less than JE16 10s. to- wards the support of the school; whilst the total amount earned by ten students of the second year was \u00a3112, giving an average of \u00a31048. per scholar. (Applause.) Mr. Howells \u2022 then distributed to the following pupils the science and art prizes awarded by the Swan- sea School Board for success in the examina- tions of the Science and Art Department:\u2014 Llewelyn Morgan, geometry, mathematics, magnetism and electricity, inorganic chemistry theoretical and practical, per- I spective Edward Phillips, geometry, mathematics, theoretical mechanics, inorganic chemistry theoretical and practical, freehand, perspective, model; Thomas A. ^Griffiths, mathematics, mechanics, magnetism and electricity, inorganic chemistry practical, M freehand, perspective and model; John L.

                "full_text": "LLANDUDNO COUNTY SCHOOL. THE. YEARS SUCCESSES. I [Special to the \"Advertiser/'] The academic year just ended will be reckoned among the more. memorable in the annals 01 tne uounty iScnooi. Vt the certaneates of tile Central -board a, larger number has been gained than in any pre- vious year. The two pupils entered for the matriculation, of the Welsh University were successtut; a slightly higher standard of work is necessary lor the senior certi- ficates the three pupils,' who aspired to, these were likewise successful. What is known as the Honours course stands above and apart from the usual course of (Second- ary School work, and implies study some- what more advanced than that required for the Intermediate examination for the London degree. Success at this stage is. attested by an Honours certificate, and one of these with a. distinction has been awarded this year. One pupil has gained one of the two exhibitions awarded to girls by the County Authority, by virtue of being placed by the examiners within the first two of all the girls in the, County. Last month the open Competition for scholarships and exhibitions was held at, the University College of North Wales. If is perhaps evidence of the position of the Welsh University in the educational world that this competition should bring together candidates from very distant, parts of the country. One obvious result is that boys and girls trained in the Welsh schools are forced to measure themselves with candidates from schools and colleges of much larger size and of much wider re- putation. It is not without interest nor significance that the winners this year should be drawn from five or six Welsh towns as well as from Ealing, Sheffield University, Southampton, Cheltenham, Winchester, London, and. Llandudno. Inrthese competitions the credit of suc- cess is more highly prized and more eagerly sought than the money value, but for the information of those who find it hard to estimate any honours not ex- pressed in terms of \u00a3 s. d., it, may be added that these two successes represent a total .of L90. The following are the results of the summer exa,mination:- HONOURS CERTIFICATE. Maud. M.

Gwna hyn nifer efrydwyr y Coleg yn 130, heblaw 60 o fechgyn yn ysgol y Coleg, yr hon, fel y cofir, a agor- .Y wyd gyntaf fis Ionawr diweddaf. Cynrychiola hon bob sir ac ysgol yn y Gogledd a'r Deheudir yn mysg yr efrydwyr newydd. Derbyniwyd pedwar o Goleg Aberystwyth a dau o Goleg Oaerdydd. Oherwydd cynydd y Goleg a'r Ysgol y mae angen mwy o arian er gwneyd darpariaeth addas ar eu cyfer. Penodwyd eisoes ddau athraw ychwanegol yn yr ysgol, sef Mr. H. O. Ridges, B.A., o Goleg y Drindod, Caergrawnt; a'r Parch. John Williams, o Goleg Dewi Sant. Bwriedir penodi yn ddioed ddarlithydd o'r newydd yn y Coleg i gymeryd yr iaith Saesneg a'r Llenydd- iaeth. Bwriedir hefyd, mor fuan ag y gellir, benodi darlithydd mewn Biology, gan fod y gangen hon o wyddoniaeth yn hynod ddefnyddiol i rai yn meddwl myned yn feddygon. Y mae eisoes amryw o gyf- leusderau yma i'r dosbarth hwn, ac argoelion fod llawer am eu defnyddio. Credwn y daw Eglwyswyr Cymru allan i gynorthwyo y Coleg i gyfarfod yr anghenion newydd a godant o'r cynydd anarferol sydd yn cymeryd lie yn nifer yr efrydwyr. Agorwyd ar ddechreu y tymor presenol Gymnasium a Fives Court newydd, a sicrhawyd gwasanaeth Sergeant Major Dallison, R.A., Aberystwyth, i roddi addysg mewn ymarferiadau corfforol, megys drill a gym- nastics i fechgyn yr Ysgol ac i efrydwyr y Coleg. Agorwyd hefyd boarding house newydd a thrydedd hostel i fechgyn, ac ardrethwyd amryw dai yn y dref yn hostels i efrydwyr. Pan nad ydyw y Coleg, oherwydd ei gysylltiad a'r Eglwys, yn derbyn dimai gan y Llywodraeth, credwn na oddef Eglwyswyr Cymru iddo fod yn ol o arian.

The elose of the academic year seems a fitting time to review its educational results, and 1904 baa proved one otf tihe meet fruitful in the re- cords of the County School. More certificates have been won than in any previous year. The Honours, Senior and Junior Certificates of tihe Central (Board1 give formal recognition of thor- ough work, extending over a far wider field than is commonly supposed. It ranges, in (faict, from the iStandlards of tlhe Oxford and! Cam- bridlge Junior Locals up to a level more ad- vanced! than that (required for the Intermediate Examination for the London Degree. Certifi- cates in MI three stages have been gained this vear. The two pupils who were entered for the Matriculation of tible Welsh \"University were suc- cessful, while four passed a higher examination at midsummer. One of the latter was placed as one. df the tJwo first of all the girls in the county, and thus 'gained one of the two exhibi- tions awarded to girls Iby t'he County Authority.

                "full_text": "MOUNTAINEERING FATAL ITY. LIVERPOOL UNIVERSITY LECTURER KILLED. SKETCH OF A BRILLIANT CAREER. A distressing mountaineering fai-ality occurred near Bethesda on Tuesday to Mr Ronald William Henry Turn bull Hudson, fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge, and lecturer on mathematics at University Col- lege, Liverpool. living at 25, Huskisson street, Liverpool. Accompanied by a friend. Mr J. F. Came- ron. of Gaius College, he left Penygwryd I Hotel, where they had arrived on the pre- vious day, on a climbing expedition above the dangerous Devil's Kitchen. Mr Hudson I fell headlong when searching for a rare fern growing in that locality. The dead body was found mangled near Lake Idwal on Tuesday night by a search party, and much disfigured, it now lies at Glanogwen Church. Bethesda, awaiting an inquest. Ladders had to be procured to reach the body, and it was brought down with much difficulty. Mr Hudson, the news of whose death created a painful sensation in Liverpool, came of a family of distinguished mathenn- ticians. He himself lully maintained the academic traditions (,f the family by his suc- cesses in pure mathematics. He was th^ I son of Mr W. H. Hudson, professor of mathematics at King's College, London, who was third wrangler at Cambridge in 1861. The late Mr Ronald Hudson was born -n Cambridge, and educated at St. Pin!0 School. He entered St. John's College, Cambridge, as [t. foundation scholar in Oc- tober, 1895. He took his B.A. in 1898, and proceeded M.A. in 1901, being appointed a Fellow of St. John's. Six vears ago he was the Senior Wrangler ) at Cambridge, and won the blue ribbon of English mathematical science two yean later, when he was Smith's Prizeman. Mr Hudson was undoubtedly one of the most distinguished of the younger genera- tion of Cambridge mathematicians. 'he Smith's Prize, which he won in 1900, is now awarded not by examination^, but upcn the results of original work. Before beiup elected in the same year to a Fellowship at St. John's, he had acted as examiner for his college, for the Technical Education Beard of the London County Council, rod as as- sistant examiner in the London University Matriculation examinations. He had pub- lished several papers before his appoint- ment to the Liverpool University, ;n Lie \"Messenger of Mathematics,\" \"ld in the \"Proc.e.edings\" of the London Mathematical Society, and two other papers read beroci the British Association. Mr Hudson's father\u2014Professor W. H. H. Hudson\u2014is well-known, both for his mathe- matical work, and also for his eminent ser- vices to the higher education of women. It has been given to few teachers to win, as he has won. the gratitude and affection of successive generations of students. A gentleman who was intimately ac- quainted1 with Mr Hudson states: \u2014 Mr Hudson was appointed to the University of Liverpool in October, 1902. He was one of the most brilliant mathematicians that the University had got. He had at the present time two works in the press on mathematics. one being in an advanced nature. Their nublicat'on was awaited with great interest. He had done a, large amount of original work in higher mathematics. No o- had a more distinguished future before him in the mathematical world than Mr Hudson. He would have bad a reputation for mathe- matics extending fat uinoi,d his own coun- trv. He had read a number of papers before the Liverpool Mathematical Sooietv. Mr Hudsor. continued the gentleman, was also a most accomplished musician, and I was weii-known Among his filends as a solo pianist. Socially he was a very attractive man, and held in the highest legard by all who knew him.",

I The distribution of prizes at the High School for Girls, Carmarthen, took place on Saturday, under the presidency of the Bishop of St. David's, who was supported by the Archdeacon of Car- marthen, the Vicar of St. Peter's (Rev A. G. Edwards), and other clergymen. An interestinv musical programme was given by the pupils, and the bishop prefaced the distribution of the prizes by remarking that that school was one of the earliest efforts which had been made to meet the demand for intermediate education for girls in Wales which had arisen within recent years. From the tone of the report of the lady principal he was sure that the standard of proficiency in the school was a hign one, and he looked for very large results from that school. The prizes distributed were at follows CLASS ii.-English, Annie Richardson modern lan- guages, Annie Richardson scripture, Annie Richard- son mathematics, Mary Jenkins. CLAiS i i i. -EazlisbL, Lizzie Davies language, Lizzie Davies mathematics, Claudia Davies scripture, Aja.h Jones. CLASS iv.-English, Sarah Reese; language, Sarah Reese mathematics, Mary Walters; scripture, Marv Walters. 0SPECIAL PRIZFS.\u2014Drawing, Mary Jenkins senior music, Annie Richardson junior music, Lizzie Davies; good conduct prize (awarded by vote of girls), Ellen Jones. Archdeacon James proposed a vote of thanks to the bishop, and said he hoped the inhabitants of Carmarthen and its neighbourhood would give the school more extended support than had hitherto been given.\u2014Rev A. G. Edwards seconded, and said the churchmen of the diocese ought to strive to make the Carmarthen High School the school for girls.\u2014The Bishop, in acknowledging the vote, endorsed the Rev A. G. Edwards's remarks, and hoped that sometime not very far in the future they would see buildings rise in Carmarthen worthy of the central school for girls in that large diocese.",

The distribution of prizes at the High School for Girls, Carmarthen, took place on Saturday, under the presidency of the Bishop of St. David's, who was supported by the Archdeacon of Car- marthen, the Vicar of St. Peter's (Rev A. G. Edwards), and other clergymen. An interesting musical programme was given by the pupils, and the bishop prefaced the distribution of the prizes by remarking that that school was one of the earliest efforts which had been made to meet the demand fyr intermediate education for Kir's in Wales which had arisen within recent years. From the tone of the report of the lady principal he was sure that the standard of proficiency in the school was a high one, and lie looked for very large results from that school. The prizes distributed were at follows :\u2014 CLASS n.\u2014English, Annie Richardson modern lan- guages, Annie Kichauison scripture, Annie Richard- son; mathematics, Mary Jenkins. CLASS HI.\u2014Enelish, Lizzie Davies language. Lizzie Davies mathematics, Claudia Davies scripture, Ajah Jones. CLASS IV.\u2014English, Sarah Reese language, Farali Reese mathematics, Mary Walters scripture, Mary Walters. ^RECIAL PRIZFS.\u2014 Drawing, Mary Jenkins senior rnuiic, Annie Richardson junior music, Lizzie Davies; good conduct prize (awarded by vote of girls), Ellen Jones. Archdeacon James proposed a vote of thanks to the bishop, and said lie hoped the inhabitants of Carmarthen and its neighbourhood would give the school more extended support than had hitherto been given.\u2014Rev A. G. Edwards seconded, and said the churchmen of the diocese ought to strive to make the Carmarthen High School the school for girls.\u2014The Bishop, in acknowledging the vote, endorsed the Rev A. G. Edwards's remarks, and hoped that sometime not very far in the future they would see buildings rise hi Carmarthen worthy of the central school for girls in that large diocese.",

                "full_text": "DISTRIBUTION OF SCIENCE AND AET PRIZES AT THE URAMMAR SCHOOL. The annual distribution of the certificates and prizes obtained by pupils of the Grammar School at the May examinations of the department of science and art, South Kensington, took place in the schoolroom, on Friday evening last. Dr Tumour, the chairman of the governors of the school, presided, and the prizes were distributed by Professor Gray of the University College of by Professor Gray of the University College of Wales, Bangor. Dr J Lloyd Roberts, Messrs E T I Jones, T J IViiiiat-ac;, J Roberts, Star Shop, (the secretary). J Davies (solicitor), W James, W H Colby, ana C Cottom, members of the local com- mittee were present. The Head-Master (Mr S Edwards, M.A.), stated that this was the ninth occasion on which thoy had had the distribution of science and art prizes. The school first entered for these examinations in I May 1880, and they had been held uninterruptedly every year since that time. The number of certificates obtained this year was 42, including 5 first class and Q. aeen's Prizes. Last year, which was an exceptionally good one, the number of certificates won was 66 including 7 first classes. The total number of certificates obtained during the nine years was 359, including 46 first classes and Queen's prizes. It would be seen from these figures that the results this year were not quite so good as those of last year, but were still very creditable and equal to the average of most years. There had certainly been no falling off in the quality 01 the teaching, which had been as efficient and painstaking as in the more fortunate year. The results of examinations were pro- verbially uncertain. He used to be able to say, on these oscasions, that Denbigh was the only Grammar School in North Wales, that bad adopted the Government system of science and art in- struction, but he had learnt that one or two other Grammar Schools had lately taken up the science departments examinations. He also read in the newspaper a few weeks back, that in Wrexham, a town that is generally to the front in movements of this kind, the Mayor had called a town's rneet- ing for the purpose of establishing science and art classses in connection with the department, so important did they deem the subject. He was pleased to see these signs of awakening interest classses in connection with the department, so important did they deem the subject. He was pleased to see these signs of awakening interest in tho subject, and he took some little credit to himself for having been one of the first to himself for having been one of the first to recognise its claims to a place in the curriculum of intermediate schools. Professor Gray delivered an interesting and valuable address, in the course of which he congratulated Mr Edwards upon the foresight and wisdom he had shown in being the first in North Wales to introduce science subjects I into a Grammar Schoal, and also upon the suc- cess he had attained, which represented a great I deal of patient work on the part of himself and the teachers. He knew there was a prejudice against introducing science subjects into those schools, and a preference given for linquistic sub- jects, but he was sure that the value of science studies could not be over-estimated, for it opened the eyes of the hov, trained his faculties, and sharpened his mind as to the objects around him, and he could assure the boys that the more they went on the more interesting would the subject become. He did not agree with the in- troduction of science subjects into elementary schools, for there it waa intended merely to lay the foundation, but in such a. school as that they were of the greatest advantage and he was sure they tended to help boys whu might otherwise be found dull, and who were dull in linguistic sub- jects examples of which he gave. He urged that when a boy bad to leave the elementary school, it should be incumbent and compulsory for him to go on with his studies (of course, devoting less hours than now to his trade or calling), and be made familiar with technical and science subjects, and so become the better fitted for his calling in life. He further, at some length, dilated on these I and similar topics, and concluded by congratulat- ing Mr Edwards and the scholars on their excellent position and then distributed the various prizes (in books), and certificates to the scholars named below. After this Dr Turnonr congratulated the boys on the very valuable ad';ice given by Professor Gray, and urged them to treasure it up. and to continue to do their best, as in these days of pressure, knowledge of all kinds was of such vast importance to them. On the motion of the Head-Master, seconded by Mr John Davies, a vote of thanks was passed to Professor Gray, who replied, and a vote of thanks to the Chairman closed the proceedings. After the distribution, the pupils were regaled with a substantial tea, and the rest of the even- ing was devotpd to music and various amusements. The programme included: Magic-lantern scenes (by Mr Colby), pianoforte pieces. Misses Edwards and Hubbard; Messrs Hall, Shepherd, Blackshaw and Aldred; songs and recitations, J R Hughes, and a faroe entitied; The Black Schoolmaster.\" The following is the list of successful students and of the certificates obtained by each.

Davies, Mr. T. Davies, B.Sc. Rev. W. T. Roberts; Mr. D. Davies, chemist, and members of the staff. The Chairman, in his opening remarks, welcomed al11 present to the annual prize distribution. He regretted, he said, that the attendance was not large, but it was not lack of interest in the school that ac- counted for that. He was glad to find that the school was well-supplied with pupils from the rural districts, and that the parents of the neighbourhood were alive to the advan- tages accruing from secondary education, and were appreciative of the educational facilities rendered accessible to their children. He also alluded to the extensions now in operation in connection with the School Buildings, viz., a new chemical llaooratory and a workship for manual in- struction, and to the erection of the steeple over the hall. In the unavoidable absence of the Head- master, the school report was read by Mr. James, the senior assistant master, which- was as follows:\u2014 La Iks and Gentlemen,\u2014I have the hon- our to present the thirteenth annual report or this school.

Our debating soc- iety had a very, successful session under the presidency of Mr. James. I am very pleased to mention that due attention is paid to athletics\u2014football, hockey and cricket\u2014 owing, to the kind services of Miss Owen, Miss Thomas and Mr. Jones. Professor Anwyl then distributad the certricates aud prize books to the successful candidates. The Professor, in th-a course of an address, said that the secondary schools of Wales had to cater for three distinct classes of pupils: First, the brilliant and highlly-giftad children; secondly, the pupils of moderate average ability; and thirds the mass or the general pupils. The teachers duty was to see that all hese were given ample opportunities for developing their innate tendencies. He also empha- sisad the fact that the pupils ought to foster more persanal initiative. Co-operation of the children with their teachers is an indis- pensable factor. The basis of truduca- tion. is this co-operation. The pupils were \"exhorted to be thorough and conscientious jn; their work, a.nd to always gi v of their \u2022Just to their teachers v A vote of thanks was passeo to the Pro- lessor, on the proposition of Major Price Lewes, seconded by Mr. J. M. Howell. Professor Anwyl in acknowledging, proposed I a vote of thanks to the Chairman, which was seconded by Mr. E. Lima Jones. The first meeting was drawn to a close by the pro- posing and seconding of a vote of thanks by the two Honours pupils to Mrs. Munro- Hughes for so generously providing the an- nual tea, etc., to the school' children. During the interval the children, etc., did ample justice to themselves by partak- ing of the fine spread. The second meeting was presided over by Mr. E. Lima Jones, who, as usual, acquitted himself with precision and tact.

A boy of 16, a pupil in the Charlemagne College, Paris, has committed suicide because his parents wished him to learn higher mathematics against his will. He had half a dozen portraits taken, put a black border to each, and then enclosed them in letters written to his father, mother, the director of the school, and several of his friends. The letters he posted before going to school, and, on arriving there, when the pupils were drawn up on a line preparatory to entering the classes, fired a revolver into his heart, killing himself on the spot.",

                "full_text": "EDUCATION IN WALES. 6 IMPORTANT LETTER FROM** DR, HARPER. We have received tho following important letter [rotn Dr. H. D. Harper, Principal of Jesus College, Oxford, whoso name is so intimately associated with higher education in Wales:\u2014 \"At the Llandovery School Prize-dav on July 27,\" says Dr. Ilarpur, I took the oppor- tunity of drawing attention to the fact that four of the Welsh Schools had been placed by their governing bodies under the Oxford and Cambridge Schools Examination Board, and I pointed out tho advantages which arise from a school being submitted in that way to an ex- traneous and authoritative examination, which iffords also a rough general comparison of its teaching with that of other schools of the country. The mode by which the comparison is arrived it is as follows:\u2014The universities which conduct ;he examinations offer certificates of merit to such candidates as reach certain standards of attain- nent, and grant distinctions to such of them as jxhibit marked proficiency. Thp ordinary pass standard ia somewhat above that for ltesponsions it Oxford. The standard for Distinction is pro- bably that for an open scholarship at a good collage, 10 that the honour of distinction is u real one, Jomo fifty or sixty schools have been examined ;his year by the board, including some of tho most important public schools of England, as well us Urecon, Cowbridga, Llandovery, and Swansea Schools, and 731- boys were presented as candidates :01' certificates. The results were published on Saturday week, and I ask your insertion of a few :iotes upon them, as highly interesting to all who ire concerned in the promotion of higher educa- tion in Wales. \"The statistics show that of the 734 candidates 584 obtained certificates as having satisfied the ixuniiiiers in four subjects at least, Of these 9 -\u2022auie from Christ College, Brecon; 1 from Cow. jridgo, 3 from Llandovery, and 2 from Swansea, the head boy at Llandovery was uufortunately ibsent through illness, or an additional certificate would, doubtless, have been credited to that school. \"Of the Brecon candidates, 11 passed in Latin, L0 in Greek. 9 in clemontary mathematics, 3 in Higher mathematics, one of thom with distinction; 7 in history, and no fewer than four of thum with iistiuction, and 12 in Scripture knowledge. \"The Cowbridge candidate satisfied tho exami- ners in Latin, Greek, elementary mathematics, a.nd Scripture knowledge. \"Of the Llandovery candidates 12 passed in Latin 13 in Greek; 16 in elementary mathe- matics; 3 in higher mathematics, and all of them with distinction; 7 in history, ono being dis- tinguished; 10 in Scripture knowledgo; 2 in natural scionco, mcchanical division; 2 in chemistry, one of them with distinction. It Of the Swansea candidates 3 satisfied tho sxaminers in Latin, one being distinguished 2 in Sreek: 2 in elementary mathenutics; 2 in higher mathematics, both being distinguished; 3 in Scripture knowledge. The four Welsh schools are, therefore, repre- sented by 27 'passes' in Latin out of a total number of 491; 26 in Greek out of 408; 28 in sloinentory mathematics out of 444 8 in higher mathematics out of 208; 26 in Scripture know- ledge out of 486; 14 in history from Brecon and Llandovery out of 344; 2 from Llandovery in nechanics out of 18; and 2 also fromHandovery in chemistry out of 23. In distinctions, 1 boy from Swansea is distin- juished in Latin out of a total of 51 boys distin- guished in that subject; 6 boys from Welsh schools ire distinguished in mathematics out of a total of tO. and 5 in history out of 42 and one boy from Llandovery is distinguished in chemistry out of a total of 8. The distinctions in mathematics and history are above the average number to be ex- pected. Had only selected boys been sent up for certi- ficates the evidence afforded of the condition of the schools generally would be worthless, but the whole sixth forms were sent up from Brecon and Llandovery, and the large number of boys who Mtisfv the examiners in each subject affords un- deniable evidence of the goodness of the teaching throughout. The fact that 14 boys from Brecon and Llandovery pass in history, and 5 of them with distinction, is especially significant, for that honour implies good and fluent English composi- tion, as well as historical knowledge. The two boys also from Swansea have received and been able to profit by good teaching. I heartily con- gratulate both tho masters and the boys upon tho position occupied by their schools in the published lists. I do not know any schools in England at which teaching of the same character and quality can be obtained at as little cost as at Brecon and Llandoverv- This is a great boast for them; but I fear that \"the teaching is given at less than cost price, and that the reputation of the schools is being maintained by the self-sacrifice of hend- masters, who are contented to find their sole ruward in the good work they are doing. I have the best reason for knowing that the total income from endowment and tuition fees is inadequate for the proper remuneration of even the assistant masters.\"",
