                "full_text": "Porth Boys' County School. Annual Distribution of Prizes and Certificates. The prizes and certificates awarded to the pupils of Porth Boys' County School Oil the examination results for 1915, \u00bb'ere dis- tributed un Tuesday evening last, at Tabernacle kE.B.) Chapel, Porth, by the Right Hon. William Abraham (Mabon), M.P. After the singing of the hymn, \u2022'O Arglwydd Dduw,\" by the School Choir, the chairman, Dr. \\V. E. Thomas, M.D., J.P., addressed the meetiing, pointing out in a few well chosen words, that Mabon, in attending the meeting, was making what was almost his first public appearance after his long and serious illness. He pointed out the great honour which Mr. Abraham had attained in becoming a member of the Privy Council, and thoug.il that a portion of the honour was reflected on the School. The song Pimpinella (Tchaikowsky), was then rendered by the School Choir of junior boys, in excellent style, after which the headmaster, Mr. E. Samuel, M.A., proceeded to deliver his report of the school work for the preceding year. in the course oi his speech Mr. Samuel dwelt upon the excellent work of the staff, and the magnificent examination results ob- tained, the upper portion of the school especially, having done exceedingly well. Two boys, Ivor A. Williams and William Hellings, had obtained County Scholar- ships of the value ot t45 per annum, for three or four years, and the former boy had received notification from the authorities of Jesus College, Oxford, that he was within a few marks of the boy who had won a scholarship at that college, of the value of JE:80 per annum for four years. With regard to the Staff there had been two changes. Mr. Redlearn, M.Sc., had joined the staff in January, and Mr. Lewis, B.A., had left at the end of July to join the Army for the period of the war. His place had been filled, temporarily, by Mr. Williams. Mr, Samuel was pleased to state that all members of the staff of military age had enlisted under Lord Derby's scheme, to come up for mititary service when called upon. Mr. Samuel then proceeded to contrast the British educational system and the German, and to show the terrible effects of militarism as taught in German elemen- tary schools. He pointed out that under our system a boy has a general education until he reaches the age of 16, and then specialises for two years before leaving the secondary school. In Germany the pupil specialises from a very early age, chiefly in modern languages, but in almost evecy ease better results are obtained under the British system. This speech, delivered in Mr. Samuel's usual capable fashion, was greeted with great applause. It was followed by an ex- cellent violin solo Le Reve, executed by Albert E. (Teddy) Smith in a very creditable manner. Mr. \\vTliiam Abraham then proceeded to distribute the cenifieatesand prizes, after delivering a short speech. He bad a message for both the staff and the boys, asking neither to be satisfied with their previous work, but to g(, oii, and climb higher and higher. They boys, he said, were being helped on now hy external aid perhaps, but after reaching a certain stage it would be by their own powers alone that they could climb. They were now being given the opportunity to conserve and build up their powers for the final unaided efforts. In a very humorous manner Mabon appealed to those present to forgive his use of notes for reference during his speech; it v.;ls embarassing to him, he said, to use them, but it was absolutely necessary. The distribution of the prizes was fol- lowed by the rendering of a Scout Song,\" by a party of junior boys dressed in the picturesque scout uniform, the chorus being sung by the School Choir. This was followed by the recitation of The Newsboy's Debt,\" a pathetic piece delievered in a style that commanded per- fect silence, and brought a tear to more than one eye. A perfect roar of applause broke out, and continued until Clifford Roberts, the juvenile elociftionist, re- turned. He then recited a humorous piece, Boys' Rights,\" which was so de- livered that frequently Clifford could not be heard by reason of the roars uf laughter he occasioned. There is no doubt that the boy will become one of our premier elocu- tionists when he grows up. He was again applauded for some time, but the chair- man was forced, on account of time, to proceed with the programme. The thanks of the assembly, proposed by Mrs. Mary Griffiths, Maes Gwyn, Cymmer, and seconded by Mrs. Florence Nicholas, the Garth, Trealaw, were unanimously signified to Mr. Abraham for the way in which he had performed his share in the ceremony. Mabon acknowledged the thanks in a neat speech, and thanked those present for the way in they had greeted him. Unfortunately, he was un- able to remain-during the rest of the pro- gramme, owing to important business. The next item was the singing of the Welsh Airs, \"Llwyn Onn and Rhyfel- gyreh Cadben Morgan,\" by the School Choir. This was followed by a vote of thanks to the chairman, proposed by Alderman Morgan Williams, J.P., and seconded by Councillor Mark Harcomur. The very successful meeting was bruoght to a close by the singing of the Welsh and English National Anthems, the former being sung by Alun Davies, Form V. Great praise is due to Mr. David Jones, M.I.S.M., for the excellent singing of the School Choir, trained by him. PRIZES AWARDED BY SIR WILLIAM JAMES THOMAS, YNYSHIR.

                "full_text": "1% PORTH COUNTY SCHOOL Annual Distribution of Prizes. I The ini) distribution of prizes and certificates to the students of the Porth I Oourty S- hpl for Boys took place at Bethlehem (C.M.) Chapel, Porth, on Thursday, the 17th inst. Mr. Tom John, M.A., J.P., took the place of Dr. W. E. Thomas, J.P., Ystrad, as chairman, the latter sending an apology to the Governors for his inability to attend the meeting. The meeting was opened by the singing of Hen Wiad fy Nhadau by a scholar of the school. The Chairman, in His address, said that education was the apprenticeship of life. At the present time we were in conflict with a natien which had given education the foremost position for many years, and yet it was a remarkable fact that the initiative, the ingenuity and self-reliant type of the Tommies at the front showed that, however advanced the Germans might be in the matter of education, the system ard form of education given in this country produced men able to be self- reliant citizens. Mr. John compared the advantages of education in the present day with that of 60 and 70 years ago, when any boy who might have enthusiasm for edu- cation had the greatest possible difficulty in getting up the educational ladder. The Junior Boys then gave renderings of the Belgian and Russian National Anthems, under the conductorship of Mr. T. Price, M.I.S.M. A recitation, entitled \"The Battle of the Bight,\" was given by Richard W. Jones (Form IV,), followed by the nong, composed from the same words by Mr. T. Price, by the Junior Boys. Report of the Headmaster. I Mr. Evan Samuel, B.A., headmaster, in his report, said:In September, 1913, the new girls' school was opened, and the boys have consequently been taught apart since that time. In the corresponding term of last year we had 173 boys on t,he roll; now we have 192. No doubt the number will reach its full complement next year. The number of boys to be educated at the school by scheme is 200, although we have comfort- able accommodation for 250. There was no extension of the work during laet year. The school, I believe, now meets the needs of the district very well. A farther extension of the commer- cial work would be an advantage, as a great proportion of our boys enter a busi- ness life of some kind or other. The triennial inspection took place in May last, when Mr. O. Owen, Mr. Robin- son, ard Mr. Lengsdon spent two days at the school tearing lessons being given and seeing the work of the school. Their report has rome to hand, and I would read it to you word for word if there had been time. The Governors have expressed satisfaction with the report. The C.W.B. examination results have been, if anything, better than in any past year. There were fewer failures. At the Junior Certificate examination, 22 out of 24 passed; at the Senior Certificate exami- nation, 16 out of 18 passed. We had three successes &t the Higher Certificate, and three at the Honours Certificate. Of the three who took the Honours Certificate, two obtained Glamorgan County Scholar- ships of the value of about 945 per annum.

PHYSICAL WELFARE. I \"We have a playing field in a very healthy and pleasant position just behind the school. Roys make full use of this for games. If it were properly drained it would make an excellent field. The boys play matches with similar schools on Satur- days, and are always accompanied by a master. They visited last veair Merthyr, Penparo, Barry, Pontypridd, CardiffAc. \"Drill is also thoroughly done in the gymnasium, both by Sergt.-Major Ward and some cf the staff, who supplement the work done by the County Drill Instructor. \"The report of the Inspector of the County Ccuncil states In Form IV. the trunk bending exercises and the marching, and the work on the ladder deserve special mention. In Forms V. and VI. the lunging, rcpe climbing, and all the vault- ing was very good. STAFF. I \"Last April, Mr. A. S. Hodgson left j ns to become the headmaster of Pentre I Secondare School. Mr. W. Jones suc- j ceeded him as senior master, and Mr. Evans became chief physics master. Mr. Redfearn, M.Sc. (Manchester), will join the staff nexit term. For the good work that has been done during the past year I have to tha.nk the members of the staff. I believe all my colleagues are permeated with a sense of the private duties of their position and of the trust reposed in them. To them, of course, is due in a very great degree the success of the work of the school.\" Mr. T. J. Hughes, the chairman of the Welsh Insurance Commissioners, before proceeding to award the prizes, said the present occasion might be considered as his official birthday, as it was just three years since that the position he now held was offered him by the Prime Minister. Education, he said, was not simply to ram into the brain isolated facts of dates, length of rivers, and such like, but to raise the ideas and to put a weapon into the hands of the young people for use at a later day. He regretted to find from the report that there was such a small proportion of boys of over the ages of 16 or 17, and considered that parents should do their utmost to keep their boys at school until they had acquired an educa- tion that would fit them for any walk in life, and instanced the\" possibilities of the Civil Service. Early this year, he said, the Commissitmers had, in the interests of Welsh secondary education, approached the Treasury and the Civil Service Com- mission, with the result that a special com- petitive examination was sanctioned and held for assistant clerks in the Insurance Commission offices. The age-limits-17-18 \u2014and the syllabus had been specially designed so as -to attract youths leaving the county schools. The Welsh Appoint- ments Board had brought particulars of the examination to the notice of the county school authorities throughout the Principality. What had been the result? There were 30 vacancies, but only 26 can- didates presented themselves. Eighteen bad obtained the qualifying number of marks, and of these thirteen came from Welsh county schools. A baker's doaen out of several hundred pupils who might have cor apet I I There would doubtless be some vacancies-be could not say how many\u2014next year. It was by no means certain that the Commissioners could in- duce the Treasury and the Civil Service Commission to repeat the experiment, but, if they did, he trusted the results would be far different. The initial experiment had proved to be far from encouraging. The post of assistant clerk was practically the first rung of the Civil Service ladder, and. although the commencing salary was low, there were increasing increments up to 9160 per annum, and, of course, infinite possibilities of promotion and advance- ment in cases of, exceptional ability and merit. He hoped the Welsh county school authorities would take the matter into serious consideration and make it im- possible for a repetition of this year's fiasco. Mr. Hughes referred to the practice in Welsh homes of keeping the front room as an almost sacred place which the chil- dren feared to enter. The front room, he said, should be at the disposal of the chil- dren. They should be encouraged to use it. and entertain their friends as much as they liked there. A new carpet for the floor was easier obtainable than a new character for a. boy. By making the home attractive, it safeguarded the children from the attractions of the streets. List of Awards.

Dr. Jones is a native of Denbigh, and won, at the age of 14, i;cm the National Sobool, Denbigh, one of the scholarships of the North Wales Scholarship Association. After a course at the Proprietary School, Merthyr Tydfil, he entered the University College of North Wales in 1888, obtaining an entrance scholarship. In 1892 he took the B.Sc. degree of the University of London, with first-class horioure in physics and second-class honours in mathematics. The college. nominated him to a Research Scholarship on the 1851 exhibition foundation, and he proceeded to the University of Berlin. Here he carried on research work at the Plh/ysical Institute, receiving from the 1851 Ex- hibit-ion Commissioners at the end of his two years' j tenure of his scholarship, a special renewal of it for a third year. In 1895 he embodied the re- sults of his researches in a thesis on \"Electro- magnetic stress,\" for which the authorities of the University of London gave him the degree of D.So.J without further examinational test. In the same year Dr. Jones became assistant lecturer and de- monstrator in physics at the college, where he has since assisted Professor Gray in class nd laboratory teaching.",

                "full_text": "I Origin of the Species. \u2666 \u2014 I Limitations of Darwin Theory. The problem of evolution in the light of Mendelian discoveries with regard to heredity formed the subject of the first part of Professor W. Bateson's presidential address on Friday night to the British Association for the. Advancement of Science which is now holding its meetings in Austra ia. Professor Bateson considered specially the nature of variation, and showed the difficulty of any longer maintaining the re- ceived doctrines on variations and the origin of the species. While they went to Darwin for his incomparable collection of facts Darwin spoke no 'onger with philoso- phical authority. In face of what they now knew of the distribution of variability in nature the sc pe claimed for natural selection in determining the fixity of the species must be greatly reduced. It has been said that in physics the age was one of rapid progress and profound sceptism. In at least as high a degree this was true of biology, and as a chief characteristic of modern evolutionary thought they must confess also to a deep but irksome humility in the presence of vital problems. Every theory of evolu- tion must be such as to accord with the facts of physics and chemistry, a primary necessity to which our predecessors paid small heed. But the physics and chemis- try of life we kn^w. next to nothing. They would be greatly helped in the study of this problem by some indication as to whether the origin of life had been single or multiple. Modern opinion was inclined to the latter theory, but we had no real evidence. Indeed, the problem still stood outside the range of scientific in- vestigation, and when they heard of the spontaneous formation of formaldehyde mentioned as a..possible first step in the origin of life, they thought of Harry Laiufer 1.\u00cen the character of a Glasgow schoolboy, pulling out his treasurers from his pocket\u2014\"That's a washer-for makkin' motor-cars\"",

JUNIOR CERTIFICATES. Elizabeth Rees Jenkins, Dinas. A CORRECTION FROM PEMBROKE DOCK. J. James, 3, Gilgal Terrace, Pennar, Pembroke Dock ,writes to inform us as follows I beg to inform you that the lists of the subjects in which I obtained a Central Welsh Board Senior Certificate was incomplete as published in your paper last week. You omitt- ed to say that I passed in Latin (with distinc- tion), and in Mathematics (with distinction). I should be obliged if you will correct this error in your next issue. Perhaps it would be con- venient if I give a correct list of the subjects in which I obtained a certificate:\u2014Composition, English Language (with distinction), English History (with distinction), English Literature, French (with distinction and conversational power), Latin (with distinction), Arithmetic (with distinction), Mathematics (with distinc- tion), Chemistry.\"",

THURSDAY, JULY 21, 1910. \u00a1 Dr. Varlsy, Principal of the Devonport I Technical School and Director of Technical Instruction in that borough, was on Wed- nesday appointed Principal of Swansea I Technical College. The successful candi- date holds the D.Sc.. degree of Manchester University obtained the Ph.D. in physics ( after two years' coarse at Strasbnrg; was I awarded the B.A. research degree at Cam- bridge after two years, devoted almost wholly to electrical research, and after- I wards proceeded to the M.A. decree of that University. He also gained the Victoria D niversity Scholaxsliip for heading final honours list in-physirs a National Scholar- ship (Board of Education), which he de- clined, and an 1851 Exhibition Research Scholarship. In the matter of practical experience, he was four and a half years assistant professor of physics and electrical engineering at the Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh, one of the two principal Tech- j nical Institutes in Scotland, with charge of the department of applied physics; for four years acted as examiner in practical physics for the Central \"Welsh Board, and has occupied his present position at Devon- port during the past two yon.rs. As the first Principal he ha-d to organise a systematic course of instruction, and completely re- organise the Evening Continuation Schools, where the number of students has more than doubled. In the making of appointments of this character, there necessarily enters a con- siderable element of chance. No absolute: test of candidates is possible. But the members of the Swansea Council, acting as an Education Committee, may take credit for having done all that was humanly pos- sible to secure the best man available for ie the headship of the Technical College. The fiv\u00ab candidates (of the 63 applying) who appeared before the Council on Wednesday had been chosen by Sir Isambard Owen, Sir Henry Reichel, and Dr. Chattaway, and the final selection was, we are happy to know, not influenced by canvassing, but 1solely by the attainments and experience of Dr. Varley, supplemented by the impres- I cion he produced upon the majority of the members in consequence of a manner bright and sympathetic, and the suggestion of geouine enthusiasm in nis work. It is possible, of course, notwithstanding the proved euocess of his labours at Devonport, that Dr. Vartey may not realise the ex- pectations formed respecting him, but in any event the selecting body has ap- proached the task of selection in a spirit that deserves its reward itf securing for the Technical College a Principal who will wisely organise the oonzsees of instruc- tion, and lay down the foandations of a future for the institution ia the highest degree beneficsai to Swansea and West Wales.",

Miss Doris M. Davies, B.A., of Cornelly Pyle, Glam., was chosen, salary f\u00a1 [;0. Miss Davies graduated B.A. with second class honours in history at Cardiff University College in 19:3, taking the norma! course and obtaining the teaching dioloma. Regarding the school curriculum and Latin, the Chairman said that this matter had been placed on the agenda because, for three years no Latin or elementary physics were taught to pupils during the first year and no pupils presented for Latin at the last junior C.W.B. examination. For boys and girls who aimed at the matriculation standard in the senior C.W.B. examination and who wished to enter certain profes- sions, the place of Latin was important. Three years ago, the late Dr. D'avies, their chairman, yielded to the clamour by parents who sent their children for a year only or two or three years to the school and who said \"WTe want them taught English and arithmetic.\" By eliminating Latin and physics for the first year after' entrance they were able to give a little more time to English and arithmetic. But a considerable proportion were handi- capped. Moreover, he contended that English was being taught when children were taught Latin. Elementary physics was in a very true sense arithmetic demon- strated. For those reasons he was inclined to go back to the old time table order. A long discussion followed and it was unani- mously resolved to replace Latin and physics in the place they occupied before the change. Mrs. T. Z. Jones was appointed a gov- ernor of the Aberystwyth College for three years. Internal scholarships were awarded and five applications for bursaries were received and four guineas given ;n each case, sub- jects to tests to be made by the Head- master.",

Mr. Davies is a native of the parish of L^angunllo, Cardiganshire, and a thorough Welshman in speech and feel- ing. A short time ago he contributed a series of very able and interesting articles to \"Cwrs y Byd (Dr. Pan Jones's monthly), his subject being \"The Borderland of Matter and Spirit.\" Like his distinguished chief, he has quite a genius for physiological and psychological investigations.",

MORGAN, of the Technical Institute and South Wales School of Chemistry, Nelson-street, Swansea, recently applied to the examining Board of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons that his Institute should be recognised as a place of instruction in chemistry, physics, and practical chemistry for the examinations which are held under the Examining Board. This has been granted, and Dr. Morgan's well-known and admir- ably-conducted Institute in Nelson-street is registered under the Examining Board of the two important medical colleges mentioned above. These Royal Colleges have also adopted another recommendation of the com- mittee, viz., that students be admitted to examination in chemistry, physics, and practical chemistry, before registration as medical students. These are important edu- cational concessions, such as ought to prove of much good in the furtherance of technical education in South Wales. Dr. Morgan intends next year to add biology to his curriculum.",

After his death it was found that he had bequeathed the bow to Signor Verdi. THE Council of the University College of Dundee has just appointed Professor J. P.

Henderson, M.A., who was recently appointed chief science master at Stonyhurst College. Mr Lunn was educated at Almondbury Grammar School, whence he gained a scholarship at York- shire College, Leeds. After three years' teaching he went to Owen's College, Manchester, to complete his B.Sc. degree. In the final B.Sc. examination he gained a first class, and was awarded the Harling Research Scholarship and Demonstrator- ship in the University, granted to the best student in physics of the year. Professor Schuster, F.R.S., professor of physics, Owen's College, says of him I was so favourably impressed by his ability and the soundness of his work that I recommended him for the Harling Scholarship, which he has held for a year. During the tenure of this scholarship he has taken part in the laboratory teaching of both elementary and more advanced students. I can join my own testimony to that of others respecting the excellence of his teaching capacity.\" During the last two years Mr Lunn has been chief science master at the Academical Institution, Coleraine, North Ireland. He is also a good athlete.",

He is an exceptionally charming and accomplished man, and is said to receive more invitations to dinner than any other man in London. He was during the life of the late Queen as welcome at Court as was the late Prime Minister, Lord Beaconsfield, whose pri- vate secretary he was. He has recently been stay- ing at Beaulieu with Lord Salisbury, who is one of his most intimate friends. PROFESSOR H. S. CALLENDAR, M.A., F.R.S., who has been appointed to succeed Professor Rucker as the Professor of Physics in the Royal College of Sciences, is a comparatively young man, being only in his 38th year. He is an old Marl- borough boy, his early education there being followed by a distinguished career at Cambridge, where he obtained a College Fellowship in Natural Science in 1886. Since then he has been at the Royal Holloway College as Professor of Physics, the M'Gill University at Montreal, and lately at the University College, London. He has fublished a system of shorthand, which he called \"Phonetic Cursive,\" but it is not popular amongst those who have to use the art of stenography most.",

Profes- sor Lodge is a Staff-ordsiiire man, born in 1851, and has been twenty yc.-trs in Liverpool. He is one of the greatest living authorities iu the world of science. For several years he has had for colleague Mr. Ben Da vies, a rising young Welshman, who has already made him- self a name in the scientific world. In the new university there will be a very large research laboratory for physics, where advanced students will be allowed to follow researches of their own or these of the pro- fessors. We have it 011 the best authority that Dr. Lodge has offered Mr. Davies the director- ship of the laboratory, and, in ail probability, he will accept the post. Mr. Davies is a native of the parish of L'angnnllo, Cardiganshire, and b. thorough Welshman in speech and feel- ing. A short iim* ago he contributed a series of very abie and interesting articles to \"Cwrs y Byd (Dr. Pan Jones's monthly), his subject being \"The Scrdarland of MRtter and Spirit.\" Like his distinguished chief, he has quite a genius for physiological and psychological investigations.",

The Council of the British Association for the Advancement of Science has nominated Professor J. J. Thomson, F.R.S., Cavendish Professor of Experimental Physics in the University of Cambridge, to be president of the meeting of the association to be held at Winnipeg next year. The investigations carried on by Professor Thomson in the Cavendish Laboratory, and by the distinguished men of science who first worked under him and received inspiration from his researches, laid the foundation for the new views held by chemists and physicists as to the electronic constitution of matter Pnd the remarkable properties of radio-active substances. In 1394 Professor Thomson \\<l'\u00ee awarded one of the Royal medals of the Royal Society, and to this was t\\dded in 1902 the Hughes Medal in recogni- tion of his contributions to the advance- ment of electrical science, especially in con- nection with the phenomena of electric discharge through rarefied ga\u00abes. Two years ago lie was the recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physics. It is understood that provision will be miade by the Canadian Government in the Estimates for the coming financial year for a grant, of \u00a3 5,000 by the Dominion Parlia- ment towards the expenses of the associa- tion's vistt to Winnipeg. The' city of Winnipeg itself proposes to make a; grant of \u00a3 1,000. 'Hie week of the meeting will piobably be from August 25 to September 1 next year.",

It may be congratulated on having done a very good year's work. Theoretical and practical chemistry and practical physics have been excellently taught. Theoretical physics has also been very well taught, but more attention should be paid to elementary me- chanics in Forms I and II. The girls have a good knowledge of botany, and have also received good training- in cookery, laur.dry work, dress-cutting and darning. Geography is good, and English has been very well taught. Good progress has been made in Latin. The amount of work done in French is not large, but the quality of it is good, and an excellent feature is the free use of the oral method of teaching. There is no balance room in connection with the chemical labora- tory, otherwise the provision made by the Governors for practical instruction in chemistry, physics, cookery, manual, and laundry work is excellent.'",

This constituted a record in the history of the school. SALE.- Yesterday afternoon Mr Howard Daniel, of the firm of Messrs Daniel, Son and Meredith, held an important sale of safes, at the Assembly Rooms. CYFARFOD PREGETHu.-The annual preaching services in connection with the Independent Chapel at Abergynolwyn were held on Thursday evening, and the whole of Friday last, when there was a large congregation at each of the meetings from Towyn, Biyncrug and Llanegryn. SerniODS were delivered by the Revs R. Thomas, Coedpoetb, and Griffith Roberts. THE MANCHESTER TRIP.-On Monday about 80 inhabitants of Towyn and district took advantage of the annual trip arranged by the Cambrian Railway Company to visit the BeIJe Vue Gardens, Manchester. The trippers returned on Tuesday morning, reaching Towyn at half-past three. EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS.\u2014A pupil of the Towyn County School named Bromley Jukes, of Aber- dovey, has been successful in gaining the first place in the honours examination of the Central Welsh Board for the county of Merioneth. The success entitles him to a Rendel and County Exhibition amounting to X20 which is tenable for three years. PERSONAL.-The Rev T. R. Jones, minister of the Bethel C.M. chapel, who has been in indifferent health for a long period, attended both morning and afternoon services at the Bethel Chapel on Sunday, when the Rev J. Roberts, B.A., Aberdovey, preached. At the close of the evening service Mr T. R. Jones, spoke a few words, in the course of which he stated that it Iwas 18 months since he had last attended the chapel. SPECIAL SERMON.-On Wednesday evening of last week a sermon was delivered at the Baptist Chapel to a good congregation by the Rev S. J. Hughes, St Dogmills, Pembroke.

REVISION COURT.\u2014On Saturday afternoon the Revising Barrister, Mr D. A. Vaughan Colt- Williams, took his seat at the Police Station for the purpose of revising the lists of voters for Lite parishes of Towyn, Llanegryn, Llanfihangel-y- Pennant, and Llangelynin. The work was all of a routine character. Sixteen new voters were successful with their claims. There were no ob- jections on either side. SECRETARY FOR 50 YEARS. \u2014 At the close of the meeting held at the Congregational Chapel on Thursday evening a presentation was made, on behalf of the British and Foreign Bible So- ciety, London, by the Rev Robert Jones, Gwyn- fa, of a handsome Bible, to Mr Hugh Pugh, as an acknowledgment of his faithful services to the Society as local secretary at Llanegryn for a period which extended over 50 years. AMBULANCE CLASSES. \u2014 On Friday evening a general meeting of the St. John Ambulance Class held in connection with the Railway Company's employees was held. The meeting which was held at the station, was presided over by Mr H. M. Jones, in the absence of the chairman (Mr R. Bowen). After some discussion it was decided that the classes shonld be resumed for the coming winter, and that the first; class should be held on Mondav next. It was unanimously resolved that Dr E. Lewys-Lloyd should again be asked to be the ecturer. OBiTUiR-7.\u2014This week we regret to announce the dbath of Mrs Foulkes Jones, which took place on Saturday at her residence, Bryutiiion, at the age of 61 years. Mrs Jones, was the widow of Dr J. Foulkes Jones, of Gothic House, Towyn, who pre-deceased her by 21 years. She was the daughter of Mr W. Parry, formerly of the Corbett Arms Hotel, where she was born. In the year 1868 she was mariied to Dr Jones, who, at that time, was the parish doctor, and had a lucrative practice in the tuwn and district. Mrs Jones was an active worker in connection with St Cad. van's Church. She was of a kind and genial dis- position and was much respected through the district. The funeral, which was private, took place on Tuesday morning at St Cadvan's Church. he Vicar, the Rev Titus Lewis, assisted by the Curate, the D. R. Pugh, M.A., officiated. The blinds of houses and business establishments on the way to the cemetery were drawn. BIBLE SOCIETY MEETING.\u2014The annual meet- ing of the local branch of the British and For- eign Bible Society was held on Thursday even- ing at the Congregational Chapel, presided over in the absence of the Chairman (the Rev P. J. Roberts), who was unable to attend owing to in- disposition, by the Rev Robert Jones, Gwynfa. An enthusiastic address was given by the Rev Ifor Griffiths, of Llanfair Caereinion, upon the Society's work at home and abroad, which was much appreciated by all present. A vote of thanks was passed to the rev gentleman, on the proposition of the Chairman, seconded by the Rev J. H. Symond. A DANGEROUS PRACTICE. \u2014 A fire broke out early on Saturday morning in Red Lion street, which, had it no tbeen for the prompt action of P.C. D. Jones, would have had a serious result. Shortly after two o'clock in the morning, P.C. Jones was aroused from his sleep by a crackling sound out in the street. Quickly dressing him- self he looked oat through the window, and saw the whole street illuminated, and found about a dozen boxes ablaze against the wall of Messrs D. Edwards and Co., printers. He im- mediately gave the alarm, and within a few min- utes there were several of the neighbours on the scene. By this time the fire had increased, and the flames were so fierce that it was almost im- possible to get near them. Water was close at hand, and after buckets upon buckets of it had been thrown the flames were extinguished. It appears that the fire was the result of a practice\" amongst the residents of that part of the town to dispose of their ashes in boxes and place them against the wall. The practice has prov- ed rather a dangerous one, and the fire will serve no doubt as a lesson to those Who are in the habit of leaving their ashes in that manner. TOWYN DEBATING SOCIETY. A preliminary meeting of tne Towyn Debating Society was held on Friday evening at Cadvan House for the purpose of making arrangements for the coming season. Mr E. Davies Hughes was vot- ed to the chair. After some discussion had taken place it was decided that a social evening should be held on the 3rd October, and that in- vitations should be sent out. According to the rules of the society, officers and committees could not be appointed at that meeting, and in consequence some suggestions were thrown out as to the course of meetings during the session. Mrs Howell Jones inquired whether some steps could not be taken to secure the Gilchrist lec- tures to Towyn during the winter, and if so she was in favour of them. Mr T. Lewis strongly advocated the securing of eloquent lecturers outside local talent for the session, as they, he said could command a good audience. No de- cision was arrived at, but judging from the en- thusiasm displayed the society will be as strong as some years ago. There is every prospect of a most encouraging, interesting and successful session. A COLD RECEPTION FOR COLLECTORS. A correspondent writes \u2014 Will you kindly allow the enclosed to appear in your paper from a Churchman? Although Mr Haydn Jones one of the leading lights of the disgraceful and illegal Welsh revolt, resides here, still the collections made towards carrying on the opposition schools' are on the whole very small indeed. The reception accorded the collectors, although care was taken to appoint respected and influen- tial residents, was cold and unsympathetic in many instances. The Calvinistic Methodists of the district are the strongest in their resent- ment. Farmers, both near and far, and shop- keepers, both big and small, are determined in their opposition to this costly and made-up agi- tation to obstruct the administration of the laws of the land. I could name you farmers and shop- keepers, respectable and law-abiding citizens of the nation, who are justly wrath that in order to raise ill-feeling against the Church it should be done at the expense of levying extra rates on all the ratepayers, an approximate rate of ltd. on all chapel members with the C.M. denomina- tion for keeping the revolt fire alight, and the prospect of an additional burdensome rate to build and maintain schools and equipment in place of Church schools (which are at present saving thousands of pounds in rates), in the event of the revolt movement proving a success, which is now a little more than doubtful. Let these Revolters ascertain of Mr Pryse Hughes' (rate collector) clerks, who recently went round for the rates, what the feelings of the ratepayers were when paying the last in- creased rate. Why, all the suggested additional rates, added to the bad seasons now experienced in Towyn, will bring the-town to the verge of bankruptcy and the ratepayers to starving point. It is high time this regime of animosity and big- otry should be brought to a close, and replaced by law abiding and peaceful citizens. Thought- ful Methodists know that if the feeling referred to as prevailing amongst the denomination is fostered there will remain .the danger of the same thing happening to the funds and chapel property of the denomination as has happened in the case of the Free Church of Scotland. Methodists are bound by their Cyff.es Ffydd (Confession of Faith), which lays it down explic- itly and unmistakably that Methodists must re- spect the laws of the land. These revolters are avowed law breakers, and those who really lovo the denomination should see to it in time mat the names of these law breakers are eliminated from the book of Church membership.\" CENTRAL WELSH BOARD EXAMINATION.

                "full_text": "PROFKSSOR3 AND STUDENTS. pIP. xhe discussion between Professor Greenhill and G. P. T.\" cannot fril, I think, to have a good effect. The things which we have to learn in phvsics are, after all, very simple, and would be easily learned if they were adequately taught. It would seem, however, that many text-hooka have been written on the same principle as that pro- duoed by the old alchemists. Truth is hidden under a mist of words and formula) to which it is difficult to ifnd the key. An amusing instance of the abuse of language in this way is supplied by Herbert Spenoer's definition of evolution, which may be new to some of our readers. Here it is 11 Evolution ia an integration of matter with a oon. comitant dissipation of motion during which the matter undergoes a chang from a definite inco- herent homogeneity to a definite coherent hetero- geneity, during which motion undergoes a parallel transformation.\" This reminds me of the lines in \"Azim, Prince of Tartarv,\" in \"The Bab Ballads His gentle spirit rolls In the melody of souls, what it meai-3. Which is pretty, but I don't know what it means. Mr Kirkman favoured the world, however, with a capital interpretation of Herbert Spencer'B defini- tion. Here it is Evolution is a sticlitogether- ation of matter with an accompanying unstick- togetheratiou of motion, during whnli matter under- goes a change from a not-weli-marked.ont not. stick-togetlier-all-alikeness, to a well-marked-out- stiok-tol{ether.not-all.alikenes8, during which the motion undergoes a like change.\" There is an old and vulgar, yet expressive saw, to the effect that fine words bntter no parsnips.\" I would have it hun up conspicuously in every classroom for the benefit of teacher and pupil alike. It is not with the use of inflated sentences, bow- ever, that I would now concern myself, but with the circumstance that professors appear to be unable to make up their minds to teach physics all in the same way. There are certain broad, yet well defined things, about which they cannot well go astray-as, for example, the rate of acceleration due to gravity. But take tho words acceleration of motion\" away from q, and we have vagueness and confusb.1. I may cite as another inscanoe of want of similarity of conception, the fact that frofessor Tait defines force in a way quite different from other teachers. Thus a pupil who was educated ni physics by Tait might not be able to pass an examination anywhere save at Edinburgh. Again, there is no mure commonly-used phrase thau centrifugal force,\" but Tait says that there is no such thing, aud that the words are monstrous. A.u inspection of not a few examination papers, and a familiar acquaintance with almost every text-book of physics which has been published in the last twenty years. and extended experience of students and their difficulties, enables me to write with some confidence on this subjeot. Physical science is badly taught in England, and it will continue to be badly taught until more common- sense is used by the teachers. I could easily name sevaral exceptions. I am personally acquainted with one professor of chemistry who stands head and shoulders above other teachers. Three professors of physics and engineering I class among my personal friends. With the teaching of none of them am I quite satisfied but there is this to be said, that all three denounce. the methods they themselves nAe, and tiay as an excnRe, 11 We have no ohanco; we have only one object in life, viz., to enable stu\u00f9ents to puss examinations.\" I am not a professional grinder, though I have helped students out of their difficulties. I have made puzzles as clear as the sun at noon-day by a rational treatment of student and puzzle alike. I can speak with some authority on this sutject, and I say that a more rational method of teaching physics is needed than is used now. The key to the whole lies in the fact that beyond the rane of our own senses we can have no knowledge of anything. We may imagiue we have, but we have not. Now as far as physics are concerned, the great thine we have to deal with is energy, aud all the information we possess on the subject goes to show that energy is not only the eftuse of motion, but motion itself in some shape or form. So long as caloric was held to be a thiiig-an eiitity-progress was impossible. The moment it became known that heat was a mode of motion, the whole aspect of one form of energy was changed. The tendency in the present day all round is to extend this view. Thus, for example, light is regarded as a mode of motion, and it is admitted that electricity and magnetism possibly are. Some five years ago the president of the North of England Chemical Society more than hinted that chemical action is a mod e of motion. As soon as this view comes to be fully adoptud, we shall have physics taught in a straightforward, intelligible way not till then. London, April 4th. J.",

The annual distribution of prizes and certifi- cates to the pupils of the Narberth County Inter- mediate School tooK place on inaay last, inere was a large and representative gathering of general public present. 1'ne Kev. T. Lewis, H.A., J.P chairman of the Governing Louy, presided, Vien'g supported on the platiorui by ProL Anwyl, \\1 A Aoerystwyth (.chairman of the Central Welsh Board), w'no presented the prizes; Alderman G. P. Brewer, Alder man Lawrence, Alderman James, Mr. \\V- Palmer Morgan, C.C.; Mr. John Morgan, M.A., (headmaster); Mr J. Bancroft (H.M. Inspec- tur of bchools); Mr. L. James (director of educa- tion); Dr. H. Lawrence, J.P.; Hev. W. S. Evans, Flynon; etc; together with the teachers, Messrs T R. Francis, ii.Sc., R. G. Richards and J. M. Davies; and the Misses E. M. Jenkins, B.A., and Bronwen Jones, B.A. The Chairman s-ud they were all grateful o Professor Anwyl lor coming down that day to dis- tribute the prizes. The Intermediate School had had a record of success from the beginning; each succeeding vear had been better than its piede- cessor. There was this year a larger number of pupils than ever before. The Chairman concluded by emphasising to the scholars the unique advan- tages afforded them by the present educat onal system as compared with the boys and girls of past years. There were numberless men and women holding higher positions in the country who had received no better education tnan they were offered there, _11_- i..1 r) The Headmaster, wlio was iouuiy *^10,uv^ before commencing on his report intimated ttia he had received a number of letters expressing regret lor absence. Among those who had writ ten were Mr. Ward, Sodstone; Miss Thomas, Hav erfordwest; Mr. Jos. Thomas Rev. J. Moms.M.A, rector of Narberth; Rev. E. J. Hugnes, Lud church; also from five of his old pupils at thai school, Miss Catherine \"Morgan, Cardiff; and MisE Elsie S. Morgan. Mr. T. \u00b15- Wlieeier, i>u\". J- j-- Evans, and Mr. D W Morgan, Aberystwyth K, ought to mention that their resources for prizes had been generously augmented by *1. Walter Jan^es, of Narbertn, another oldp P^P11- He was glad to see so many old pupils there that day, as he always liked prize day to be consider- ed a re-union of present and past pupils of the School. They should feel proud that their prizes were going to be presented to them by Professor AnwyJ^who was the pioneer of the Lniversity College of Wales. (Cheers.) That college had been built on the good-will of the nation, and it had a very warm place in the affection of the Welsh nation. In him also they had the chair- man of the Central Welsh Board, and a man of whom it would be difficult to sum up the variety and versatility of his accomplishments in every department of education. In a review of the past vea^ne most striking feature he (the headmaster) thought was the re- markable increase in the number of puphs- At the beginning of last year there were 96 attend- ing the school; there wE\u00a5e now 106 pupils. On the resignation of Mr. Parry the Governors had found it necessary to appoint a new master for woodwork, Mr. J. M Davies, who had proved him \u2014 self a most able master. Since that time it had been decided to add the Welsh language to the school curriculum. New courses had also been started in laundry and cooKery. Of the pupil tea- chers four had successfully passed the prelimin- ary examination for tire certificate. Alice Evans, Gertrude E. Davies, Emma Howell and Elsie Vaughan. For the Central Welsh Board exami- nation nine senior and eignt junior certificates had been granted in the order following:\u2014 SENIOR CERTIFICATE. Eva Dorothy Cole, in English composition, 'his- tory, French, arithmetic (with distinction), mathe- matics, physics (with distinction), chemistry (with distinction). \u201e Edward Lewis Davies, in English composition, history, French, arithmetic (with distinction), mathematics, physics (with distinction), chemistry David Gibby, in English composition, history, French, Latin, arithmetic, mathematics, physics (with distinction), chemistry.

Professor Anwyl, whose rising was greeted with loud applause, then presented the prizes and cer- tificates to the winners in the Central Welsh Board examination, as already given. In addi- tion to the senior winners, Emrys Hughes ob- tained a prize for distinction in physics. The following were also presented with prizes and certificates for creditable work \u2014 Form II \u2014David John Howells, Ethel Griffiths, Gladys Llewellyn, Olive Evans, Gwen Wheeler, \"Winnifred Vaughan. Form I (girls). Mary Jones, Lilian Bowen, Margaret A. Adams, Clementina Thomas. Boys: Wm. T. Lewis, Chas. G. Harries, Carlyle Davies, and Wm. 0. Lewis. Pupil teachers' centre.-Alice Evans, Gertrude Davies, Emma Howell, and Elsie Vaughan. Professor Anwyl said his duty had been a plea- sant one. He was aelighted to see the very clear evidence of the interest which was taken in that school by the neighbourhood. And there was ob- viously a real enthusiasm for the work of the school in everyone connected with it,' not only within the school, but without. There was evi- dence that good, sound headwork was being pur- sued there year after year. It was no small thing that a school started like this one in a district which was not a thickly-populated one, but which had nevertheless so well fulfilled the educational needs among which it was placed. He wished the school most heartily a continuation of its successes. He hoped also that the young people would make it one of their chief aims to be able to express their ideas accurately. In conclusion he thanked them most cordially for their kind invitation to him to distribute the prizes. iAp- lause.) Mr. Bancroft spoke at some length also of the utility of literature. He would also like to add the praise of Greek. It seemed a pity that this language was not taught in any of the County Schools in Pembrokeshire, nor in Carmarthen- Mr James said he was pleased to hear that Welsh had now been added to the languages taught in the school, as the larger percentage of the pupils would have to speak it in after life. He expressed his heartiest cnogratulations to the Headmaster and the teaching staff on the, excel- lent results obtained this year.",

The research scholarship given by her Majesty's Commissioners for the Exhibition of 1351, to which Mr. Edward Ta.ylor Jones, B.Sc., was nommateo in 1892 by the University Col- lege of North Wales, has been renewed for a third year. Such renewal is only made in cases of exceptional merit, where valuable scientific results are likely to be obtained by a con- tinuance of the scholar's research work. Mr. Jonos is an old North Wales Scholarship Association scholar., aaid student and scholar of the Univer- sity 'College of North Wales, and took his dco'ree with great distinction in physics and mathematics in 1S52. He has just completed at the University of Berlin an experimental inves- tigation solving an important problem in mag- netism!

It seems that for many years he has been working silently at a method of directly utilising atmospheric electricity\u2014that is to say. without chemicals or dynamos\u2014and of making practical appli- cation of it without the need of employing any motive force. He claims to have invented a. generator which can collect the electric fluid, to be able to store it and apply it to infinite purposes, for instance, in connection with shops, railways, and manu- factures. He says he is expecting that its effect will be a tremendous economic and industrial revolution.",

It has be-on discovered that eczema, the most common of all skin troubles, is not a blood disease, but is due to an inflamed oon- dition of the skin. Internal physics will not effect a cum. This dangerous and distressing disease is best eradicated by direct external applications of the new discovery, Cadum. It stops the itching at once and begins the heal- ing process with the first application. For pimples, blackheads, blotches, rash, scaly skin, sores, chafings, &c., nothing else cures like Oadum. For seven years I was troubled with eczema on my legs and arms, with con- siderable itching and soreness. I never saw anything so wonderful as the way Oadum cleared my ,skin. In two weeks the spots had all gone.\"\u2014Mr. C. Weekes, Lower Gate, Ties- hurst. Trial box 6d., large box Is., of chemists or Omega, Ltd., London, N. w!819\u20142",

Born in New Zealand in 1871, Pro- fessor Rutherford was educated in his native land and at Cambridge. He obtained the degree of D.Sc., New Zealand University in 1901, and of LL.D. Universities of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in 1906. In 1905 he was awarded the Rumford Medal by the Royal Society, and last year he won the Bressa Prize of the Turit Academy of Science. Between 1898 and 1907 h< was Professor of Physics at the M'Gill University Montreal, and since last yoir has been Professoi qnd Director of the Physical Laboratory at Man. Chester University.",

Such renewal is only made in cases of exceptional merit, where valuable scientific results are likely to be obtained by a continuance of the scholar's research work. Mr Jones is an old North Wales Scholarship Association Scholar, and student and scholar of the University College of North Wales, and took his degree with great distinction in Physics and Mathematics in 1892. He has just completed at the University of Berlin an experimental investi- gation solving an important problem in magnetism. An account of the research has been communicated to Her Majesty's Commissioners and will shortly be published.",

In his report, the Headmaster stated that it was the usual thing for him to read his annual report. This term, he would content himself by saying that the standard of (efficiency had been fully maintained and H.e number of pupils had gone on increasing. The Headmaster then gave statistics which dealt with a term of ten years. Up to the end of the year, 495 pupils had been under instruction. During the ten years, forty-one pupils left the School after staying one term, thirty-two after two terms land 97 after three terms. In 1899. the amount expended in scholarships amounted to \u00a3138 Os. Od. in 1900, \u00a3 123 10s.; in 1901. \u00a3 132 Os. Od.; in 1902, \u00a3 127 19s.; in 1903, \u00a3 173 15s.; and in 1904. JB168, a total of JE862 14s. spent in scholarships in six years. These scholarships made it pos- sible for poor pupils of primary schools to obtain the advantages of secondary educa- tion.

(Applause). During the past six years, the sum of \u00a31.73.5. has been gained in scholarships and exhibitions Mr. Darlington, in a short address, con- gratulated the School on its success. It was interesting for him to notice the success of children who had been under his observation at the primary schools and to seJe them succeeding in so efficient a manner in the secondary Schools. Mr, Darlington then dealt at Some length with the secondary ledu- cation of the county and said although he was an inspector of primary schools, he took a. great deal of interest in secondary educa- tion. Secondary education was now brought up to such an efficient standard tTlat they were able to compete with any of the London schools. There was no other school in Wales which could be compared with the Towyn School. On the proposition of Mr. J. M. James, seconded by Mr. Mictyrick Roberts, a vote of thanks was accorded Mr. Darlington and the meeting terminated.",

It has been discovered that eczema, the most common of all skin troubles, is not a blood disease, but it is due to an inflamed condition of the skin. Internal physics will not effect a cure. This dangerous and distressing disease is best eradicated by direct external applica- tions of the new discovery, Cadum. It stops the itching at once and begins the healing process with the first application. For pim- ples, blackheads, blotches, eruptions, prickly heat, rash, scaly skin, sores, channgs. etc., nothing else cures like Cadum. For seven years I was troubled with eczema on my legs and arms, with considerable itching and sore- ness. I never Saw anything so wonderful as the way Cadum cleared roof skin.

Well done, the Emperor, for thus bringing up his child The course of education in the live lyceums of Paris comprises the Greek, Latin, English, and German languages, philosophy, physics, chemistry, literature, mathematics, history, and geography and in which there will be a general competition amongst the pupils for prizes.

Sir,\u2014In your account of the prize distribution of the County School Dolgelley I am incorrectly reported to have said science is a dead thing.\" What I did say was that we had an elaborate system of education but that \"system was a dead thing and could not inspire but only guide. I may say that 1 have the highest opinion of the value of science teaching in our schools and special attention has always been paid to science in Dolgelley. The only change is that the science course has been re- organised and mol\") attention given to physics, to meet the requirements of the Board of Education. ARTHUR CLENDON.",

DEATH OF SIR JOHN CONROY. \u2014 News reached Oxford on Saturday afternoon of the death of Sir John Conroy, Bart., of Llanbrynmair, Bedford Lecturer in Physics at Balliol College, which took place that morning in Rome. Sir John had been in week health for some time, and went abroad rather more than three months ago. His charm of manner, his modesty, and his kindness made him one of the most popular of Oxford men. Born in August, 1845, Sir John Conroy succeeded his father, Sir Edwar i Conroy, as third baronet in 1869. Sir Edward Conroy's sister, Victoria Marie Louise, married as his first wife, the late Sir Wyndham E Hanmer, Bart. Sir John Conroy was unmarried, and the baronetcy, which was granted in 1837, becomes extinct.",

With a clear sky, the heat derived from \"Old Sol\" when he is high is estimated to be equivalent to about 7,000 horse-power per acre; and, according to Sir J. J.

When coal is exhausted, and our water- power is inadequate, it may be, he says, that the centres of industrial activity will be 4 transferred to the burning deserts of the Sahara, where the tapping of the sunbeams could better be done. Sir Joseph furthermore mentioned that all matter is probably composed of holes, and that the ether, through which all the benefits of the sun really come to us, is probably of about 2,000 million times greater density than lead.",

When coal is exhausted, and our water- power is inadequate, it may be, he says, that the centres of industrial activity will be transferred to the burning deserts of the Sahara, where the tapping of the sunbeams could better be done.

Francis Jones, son of Mr. Edward Jones, architect and diocesan surveyor for the Diocese of St. Asaph, passed, on the 10th inst., most seccessfully the primary examination for the Royal College of Physicians of London, the subjects being chemistry and chemical physics, materia medica, medical botany, and pharmacy. We hear of a curious rating oversight on the part of the authorities in the neighbourhood of St. Asaph. It seems that a rumour was given currency to that the residence of Mr. Kendall, at Bodelwyddan, had not been rated for several years. Information was given to the auditor of this, and that gentleman postponed the meeting for the purpose of making inquiries. It is said that he found the above in- formation to be correct, and ordered the overseers to be surcharged. The place is rated at about X350 a year..",

I In a report just issued Mr. Rumbold, of the Embassy at Vienna, sketches the system of commer- cial education in Austria-Hungary, which is designed to prepare pupils for their various callings in life. At present there is a three years' theoretical course, which it is proposed to extend by one year's practical acquaintance with the trade or profession which the students desire to enter. In the commercial schools the following subjects are compulsory English or Italian, German, French, geography, history, mathe- matics, trade and office work, bookkeeping, commer- cial law and law of exchange, physics, chemistry, and caligraphy. The students spend 31 hours per week in the classes. During the three years apprentices are expected to attend lectures on their special pur- suits for two hours every evening. This has been found too exhausting after a hard day's work, and some less severe system is to be introduced.",

Bulke ley Price in the chair. A resolution was passed with reference to the death of Sir Henry Tate, who was a life governor of the College and had been a generous donor to its funds, giving liberal assistance in particular to the scientific and tech- nical departments of its work. Out of a. strong field of candidates, Mr Edward Taylor Jones, D.Se., was appointed Pro- Gray. Dr Jones is a native of Denbigh, fessor of Physics in succession ao Professor and won at the age of 14 from the Na- tion:-i1 School, Denbigh, one of the scholar- ships of the North Wales Scholarship Association. After a course at the Pro- prietary School, Merthyr Tydfil, he en- tered the University College of North Wales in 1888, obtaining an entrance scholarship. In 1892 he took the B.Se. degree of the University of London, with First Class Honours in Physics and Second Class Honours in Mathematics. The Col- lege nominated him to a Research Scholar. ship on the 1851 Exhibition foundation, and he proceeded to the Universitny of Berlin. Here he carried on research work at the Physical Institute, receiving from the 1851 Exhibition Commissioners at the end of his two years' tenure of the scholar- ship a special reward of it for a third year. In 1895 he embodied th results of his re- searches in a thesis on \"Electro-magnetic stress,\" for which the authorities of the University of London gave him a degree of D.Sc., without further examinational test.. In the same year Dr Jones became Assistant lecturer and demonstrator in physics at the College, where he has since assisted Professor Gray in class and labora- tory teaching. It was resolved to hold a special meeting of the Council on anuary 10th to appoint a successor to Mr W. J. Woodhouse, Assistant lecturer in dreek and Latin, who leavecs Bangor to take up an appointment in the University of St, Andrew's. The Senate announced that the committee of the Liberal Memorial to Mr Gladstone proposed to place at the disposal of the College a biennial prize of E5 in books to be given for proficiency in history, political science, and economics. A vote of thanks was accorded to the President, Mr Vv. Rathbone, for his gift to the College of a portrait of th late Mr Mundella, with an inscription recording Mr Mundella's services to the cause of Welsh intermed- iate education. A letter was read from the Worshipful Company of Drapers, announcing that the Company would give \u00a3 200 a year for a period cf thre years towards the maintenance of the depart- ment of electrical engineering, pending the establishment of the department on a per- manent foting. The Permanent Buildings Committee (upon which the Bangor City Council is represented) presented a report offering for the consideration of the Coun- cil several alternative schemes. It was resolved to submit the whole question to a special meeting of the Court of Governors, to be held about the middle of January. and in the meantime to make enquiry as to possible sites.",

The entrance age is twelve, and during the first three years all the lessons, four per diem, are obligatory, the chief subjects being the French language and literature, English and German, geography, arithmetic, elements of science, drawing and singing, with sewing and gymnastic exercises, twice a week; zoo- logy in winter, and botany, accompanied by botanising walks in summer. In the fourth and fifth years, French and modern languages, ancient history, astronomy, and cosmography, domestic economy, and animal and vegetable physiology are obligatory, while ancient literature, elements of Latin, mathematics, physics, singing, and drawing are optional. We thus perceive that France is now devoting as much attention to the solid education of both sexes as we are now doing ourselves.",

The Mathematical Section separated into two divisions, a series of papers on mathematics being read in the first, and addresses relating to general physics being given in the second. Pauperism was discussed in the Economic Section, and canals and irrigation in the Mechauical Section. Excursions were arranged to various places of interest. The most interesting paper of the day was that of Mr John King on the policy of exercising a dis- crimination between the deserving and undeserving in the giving of public poer relief. On the general question beheld that there should be no exercise of discrimination between good and bad paupers but when the nature of the relief came to be considered, a minor discrimi- nation might be judiciously exercised.",

OLIVER LODGE, F.R.S. \u00bb- \u2014 \u25a0\" \u25a0 \u2014\u2022 The president of the Mathematical and Physical Science Section is an able young man,\" having been born in 1851, at Penkhull, a village near the Staffordshire Potteries. He is a striking instance of successful self-culture. At 14 he was put into business with his father in the Potteries, and remained there for six or seven years. During this time, he informs us that he made his first acquaintance with science by reading an odd monthly number of the English Mechanic, and afterwards picking up what he could from the articles of the \"Penny Cyclopaedia.\" Later, 'while on a visit to London, he heard a course of six lectures on Heat by Tyndall, at Jermyn- atreet, and also attended a private course on elementary chemistry. He then began to attend evening classes in chemistry under the Science and Art Department at the Wedgewood Insti- tute, Burslera; and in 1872 was permitted a winter's course at the South Kensington Chemical Laboratory, on the annual examination list of which he came out bracketed first. In 1871, by working at odd hours, he matriculated at the University of London, and after two years of private study, passed the intermediate exami- nation for a science degree, having failed in botany at the first trial. In this examination he obtained honours in chemistry and physios, stand- ing alone in the first class in the latter subject. In 1875 he took his B. Sc. degree and the post of demonstrator of physics at University College, London, was created and offered to him about the same time. In 1877, he took his degree of Doc- tor of Science, choosing experimental electricity as his special: subject. Dr Lodge is the author, 1877, of a treatise on Elementary Mechanics,\" published as one of Chambers's Series. Since its first publication, this book has had a very success- ful sale, having run through several editions. In 1881, Dr Lodge was elected to the Professorship of Physics and Mathematics at the New Univer- sity College in Liverpool. At the end of a year the chair of mathematics was en- dowed, and Professor Lodge was thus relieved of this part of his onerous task, retaining the Pro- fessorship of Physics, which he still holds. He delivers on an average ten or twelve lectures weekly during eight months of the year; but this is not all. He is a member of the Council and of the Library and Building Committees of the College, and in the case of an institution growing so rapidly as that at Liverpool, these take up a considerable amount of time. He is also one of the examiners in sound, light, and heat for the Government science and art examinations, and is tn examiner in physics at the University of London. As Professor at one of the three con- stituent colleges he is also an examiner for Vic- toria University. In the spring of 1888, the University of St Andrews conferred upon him the honorary degree of LL.D., and shortly after- wards he was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society. He has been a member of the Physical Society since 1875, and is now on the Council. At the meeting of the British Association at Montreal in 1884 Professor Lodge delivered an evening discourse on \"Dust,\" and, from 1878 to 18841 he was one of the secretaries of section A. He is a member of the Institute of Electrical Engineers. Moreover, he is interested in the subject of Hypnotism, and has communicated papers at various times to the Society for Psychical Re- March, of whose Council be is a member.",

In a report just issued Mr. Rumbold, of the Embassy at Vienna, sketches the system of commer- cial education in Austria-Hungary, which is designed to prepare pupils for their various callings in life. At present there is a three years' theoratical course, which it is proposed to extend by one year's practical acquaintance with the trade or profession which the students desire to enter. In the commercial schools the following subjects are compulsory English or Italian, German, French, geography, history, mathe- matics, trade and office work, bookkeeping, commer- cial law and law of exchange, physics, chemistry, and caligraphy. The students spend 31 hours per week in the classes. During the three years apprentices are expected to attend lectures on their special pur- suits for two hours every evening. This has been found too exhausting after a hard day's work, and some less severe system is to be introduced.",

It stops the itching at once and begins the healing process with the first application. For pimples, blackheads, blotches, eruptions, prickly heat, rash, scaly skin, sores, chafings, etc., nothing else cures like Cadum.

The examination for inspectors will be in factory, truck, and compensation laws, political economy, sanitary science, physics, chemistry, mechanical and electrical engi- neering, and the examination for assistants will be chiefly confined to a knowledge of factory legislation, sanitation, and English. The increase in the staff will affect South Wales, because at present the Welsh staff is too small for the work, there being only Mr. Augustus Lewis in charge.

Searle, University Lecturer in Experi- mental Physics, Cambridge. The universe, he said, contained matter in very vigorous motion, both in bulk, as eeen in the earth's motion round the sun, and in detail, as seen in the molecular vibrations which gave rise to light. Hence the state of the universe to-day differed from its state yesfiprday, and so on. Modern investigations had sin own that while the total amount of energ-y remained unchanged there was at present a progres- sive diminution in its availability, and they pointed remorselessly to a time when the energy would be so distributed that further redistribution would be impossible. When this came to pass the universe would be physically and chemically inert; in simple words, it would be dead.",

Internal physics will not effect a cure. This dangerous and distress- ing disease is best eradicated by direct external applications of the new discovery, Cadum. It stops the itching at once, and begins the healing process with the first application. For pimples, blackheads, blotches, eruptions, prickly heat, rash, scaly skin, sores, cihafings, &c., nothing else cures like Cadum. \"For seven years I was troubled with eczema on my legs and arms, with con- siderable itching and soreness. I never saw anything so wonderful as the way Cadum cleared my skin. In two weeks the Spots had all gone. \"\u2014Jir. C. Weekes, Lower Gate, Tice- hurst.

Poor Mr. Rocke I have never had the pleasure of seeing him, but after his game effort to try and beuefit his townies,\" as they call them out West, has got. what all earnest men get\u2014\"kicks.\" But out West,\" if one member of Council or Congress, give another the lie direct, there is sure to be Colts and coffee at sunrise or a knuckle dusting on the spot. and it is much better than bottling up a grudge the blood-letting lessens the terapeiature. Now it looks as if the officials in Swansea have been having a high old time. If there is not an exodus of those who are bolstering up extravagance, then give us \"Home Rule\" and the \"Old Parliamentary Hand,\" who is known as the Grand Old Man. There, again, the epidemic is raging furiously in the brains of the would-be Cabinet makers. It pervades the Church and Chapel, even in Wales, where piety is provtrbial and charity covering her as with a garment. But, Mr. Editor, it is a great thing that there is a law of the\" survival of the fittest,\" whether in language, politics, religion, physics, or systems; and, if the lan- guage, the politics, the physics, or systems is not the Mtestlthen they must (?o to that limbo \"from whose bourne no traveller returns.\" It will be all right Mr. Rocke in a hundred years hence,\u2014\" keep up your pecker,'and if you are the fittest you will survive; if not, you must go where the good Niggers go,Yours obediently. Oyster oi mouth, Jnly 20, 1886. SALVE.",

                "full_text": "DEATH OF PROFESSOR MAGNUS. Professor Tyndall, in last week's Nature, writes;- On the 4th of April, 1870, at a quarter-past ten p.m., died peacefully, after a long illness, Dr. Gustav Magnus, Professor of Physics, and Director of the Physical Cabinet in the University of Berlin. He was an experimental philosopher of great and varied ex- cellence, executing his work with the choicest appa- ratus and with the most conscientious care. His numerous labours are known to ail students of physics, and they are such as to secure for him an enduring fame. On the 28th of April, 1851,1 first saw Professor Magnus on his own doorstep in Berlin. His aspect won my immediate regard, which was strengthened to affection by our subsequent intercourse. He gave me a working place in his laboratory, and it was there I carried out the investigation on diamagnetism and magne-crystallic action, which is published in the Philosophical Magazine for September, 1851. In 18531 was again in Berlin, and found under hisroof the same ready help and sympathy. Professor Hurst and myself paid him a visit last summer; and he after- wards attended the Exeter meeting of the British As- sociation, where his frank, genial, and gentlemanly demeanour were conspicuous to all. Over and above his direct contributions to science. Professor Magnus exercised a powerful indirect influence, through the kindly aid and countenance which he lent to young in- quirers. When I bade him good-bye in 1851 his last words to me were, \"If you should meet any really able young fellow, willing to work, and to whom such assistance as I can render, would be valuable, send him to me.\" There are many such, now no longer young, who, like myself, will mingle a grateful memory of his goodness with their grief for his loss.",

A letter relating to the desirability of varying the scheme of examination for the entry of dockyard and Naval shipwright apprentices has been sent to the superintendents of the various Royal Dockyards. The alterations which were suggested to the Admiralty by the Civil Service Commissioners, and in which their Lordships fully concur, are conceived with the view of widening the area from which such apprentices are drawn. They are (1) to group the English subjects, orthography, handwriting, grammar, and composition, hitherto set as separate subjects, each carrying a maximum of 100 marks, together under the head of \"English\" with a maximum of 400 marks: (2) to add the elements of chemistry and physics as an alternative to geography. The Commissioners do not think it desirable at this stage to define the range of the exami- nation by a syllabus, but the scope of the new subjects may be taken to be about the same as that at present covered by the papers set for boy copyists in the Civil Service (3) to raise the maximum of geography and its alternative subjects as above to 150 marks, thus placing it on an equality to euclid and algebra (4) to substitute for a qualifying standard in a few of the subjects a a qualifying aggregate of marks on the whole exami- nation. The scheme of examination as amended will be therefore as follows :-Arithmetic (as now), 350 marks; English (including handwriting, orthography, and com- position, with special reference to grammatical accuracy), 400 marks: geography or chemistry and physics, 150 marks; euclid, 150 marks; algebra, 150 marks: total, 1,200 marks. The qualifying aggregate must be such as will satisfy the Civil Service Commissioners.",

Professor Tyndall, In last week's Nature, writes:\u2014 On the 4th of April, 1870, at a quarter-past ten p.m., died peacefully, after a long illness, Dr. Gustav Magnus, Professor of Physics, and Director of the Physical Cabinet in the University of Berlin. He was an experimental philosopher of great and varied ex- cellence, executing his work with the choicest appa- ratus and with the most conscientious care. His numerous labours are known to all students of physics, and thev are such as to secure for him an enduring fame. On the 28th of April, 1851, 1 first saw Professor Magnus on his own doorstep in Berlin. His aspect won my immediate regard, which was strengthened to affection by our subsequent intercourse. He gave me a working place in his laboratory, and it was there I carried out the investigation on diamagnetism and magne-crystallic action, which is published in the Philosophical Magazine for September, 1851. In 18531 was again in Berlin, and found under his roof the same ready help and sympathy. Professor Hurst and myself paid him a visit last summer; and he after- wards attended the Exeter meeting of the British AI- sociation, where his frank,.genial, and gentlemanly demeanour were conspicuous to &IL Over and above his direct contributions to science. Professor Magnus exercised a powerful indirect influence, through the kindly aid and countenance which he lent to young in- quirerg. When I bade him good-bye in 1851 his last words to me were, \"If you should meet any really able young fellow, willing to work, and to whom such assistance as I can render, would be valuable, send him to me.\" There are many such, now no longer young, who, like myself, will mingle a grateful memory of his goodness with their grief for his loss.",

Professor Tyndall, in last week's Nature, writes:- On the 4 th of April, 1870, at a quarter-past ten p.m., died peacefully, after a long illness, Dr. Gustav Magnus, Professor of Physics, and Director of the Physical Cabinet in the University of Berlin. He was an experimental philosopher of great and varied ex- cellence, executing his work with the choicest appa- ratus and with the most conscientious care. His numerous labours are known to all students of physics, and they are such as to secure for him an enduring fame. On the 28th of April, 1851,1 first saw Professor Magnus on his own doorstep in Berlin. His aspect won my immediate regard, which was strengthened to affection by our subsequent intercourse. He gave me a working place in his laboratory, and it was there I carried out the investigation on diamagnetism and magne-crystallic action, which is published in the Philosophical Magazine for September, 1851. In 1853 I was again in Berlin, and found under hiM roof the same ready help and sympathy. Professor Hurst and myself paid him a visit last summer; and he after- wards attended the Exeter meeting of the British As- sociation, where his frank, genial, and gentlemanly demeanourwere conspicuous to all. Over and above his direct contributions to science. Professor Magnus exercised a powerful indirect influence, through the kindly aid and countenance which he lent to young in. quirers. When I bade him good-bye in 1851 his last words to me were, If you should meet any really able young fellow, willing to work, and to whom such asaistanca as I can render, would be valuable, send him to me.\" There are many such, now no longer young, who, like myself, will mingle a grateful memory of his goodness with their grief for his loss.",

DISTRIBUTION OF PRIZES. the anuual entertainment and distribution of pnzes in connection with the Towyn County School was held on Thursday evening at the Assembly ~7?oms- There was a large and representative attendance. The chair was taken by Mr William Jones, Aberdovey, and the Hon 0. H. Wynn, Rug, distributed the prizes. The operetta entitled Maritana\" was performed during the evening by he school choir, consisting of about 120 voices, ^he stage had been very effectively got up, the scenery having been specially painted by Mr J. R. Jaughan, and reflected great credit on him. The dramatis personse were Maritana, Madeleine The Queen Gitana, I. John; Don Caesar, D. !*\u2022 Jones; Capt of the Guard, Arthur Phillips; \"\u2022azarillo, J- Owen Jones; Priest, J. E. Thomas; Alcade, Maurice Williams; Notary, D. W. Lloyd; Young Soldier, Howard Spicer; Soldiers, Edward \u25a0Rowlands, Emrys Morgan, J. E. Davies, W. G. Owen, Heibert E. JoBes, Trevor Jones. The Chairman in opening the proceedings said fie would not detain them very long as he was more fluent in the Welsh rather than the English language, otill he was greatly interested in education, though 9 Personally had not had the advantage of having an Intermediate School training, but had had to be satisfied with the training given at evening schools. II\", intended to invest the little money which he Possessed in education. They themselves would not benefit by it, but their children would be vastly benefited. The school deserved their best efforts, j-or its success had been something marvellous, and .ere was ne school which could be compared with jt. This had been due iu a great measure to the late Mr Corbett, Ynysmaengwyn, and another great friend whom be hoped would live for a good many p .To%ra longer (hear, hear). He would like to refer to one question which would hare to be shortly faced by the Governors, and that WttS the question of increasing the school premises. For this they Would require a sum of at least \u00a3 1,500, and he that the peopie- A ftdjacenfc towns Would oe as liberal as they had been deiuiw. He might say with regard to Aberdovey that that place had benefited as much as anywhere (cheers) Scene 1 of the operetta was then proceeded with. The principal characters were well represented and the singing of the choir was distinctly good. The headmaster afterwards readhisannual report,which has already appeared in our columns. Before calling upon Mr Wynn to give away the Prizes, the chairman, referring to the headmaster's report, and said it was one of the best he had eyer listened to; and he did not think there was a school in \"Wales which could show snch good results. He had dwelt upon the need of increased accommoda- tion and they would have to do their best to meet his requirements. He thought that money spent in this manner was a very safe investment for all of them. There was future before them as a Welsh Nation in those schools, which were the stepping stones to the Universities (cheers). Mr Wynn then handed over the prizes to the successful scholars The fullowing were the prize-winners :-Form VI. (general excellence) Winifred Conn, A. C.

Daniel William Lloyd, Special Rendel Exhibition of \u00a3 10 (given to the boy who took the 2nd place in the County of Merioneth). The Hon C. H. Wynn said it had given him the utmost pleasure to present, the prizes as he took the greatest interest in the education of the County of Merioneth (hear, hear). He congratulated the pupils on their success. It was no small matter to have won these prizes after the keen competition to which they had been subjected. His advice to those of them who had not been successful was not to worry or fret over it, for with exertion and dili- gence, their talents would serve them excellently in their future life. The next point was the progress of the Towyn County School. It was started in May, 1894, and it had increased so much in effici- ency that other schools six or seven times its strength could not be compared with it. In hon- ours and certificates it stood above them all (cheers). There was another very healthy sign. He bad observed from the report of the headmaster that the school was gaining in point of numbers and not diminshing. This gave evidence that the efforts of those who had established it were not a mere flash in the pan for the school was gradually and steadily springing up in this direction. This re- flected great credit on the school staff, the governos and the parents. He would like to pay a compli- ment to those parents who assisted the schools by allowing their children to remain sufficiently long in elementary schools and afterwards in the county schools so that their education was of real value. Addressing the pupils, he said that from a school boy's point of view the school years were not perhaps the happiest, but in after life they would realize that they really were. In his school time there was supposed to be a voluntary school in each district but it was often very badly equipped and the at- tendance was quite irregular, and their education was nipped in the bud at the very point where they should have been encouraged to go on. At the present time they had educatioual facilities of the highest order brought to their very doors as it were, and he hoped they would appreciate it at its true value. There was one thing which the headmaster had mentioned and that was that only nine girls had remained in the school for over two years. This was a serious matter, for to take away their children just as they were commencing was like throwing money away into the sea. It was very unfortunate when they only paid zE5 for the year and the boarders about \u00a325. He himself had been sent away for 150 miles and they were glad to get rid of him for six months (laughter). This cost JE150 for a course very little better than what they would get at any elementary school in the present day. They got at Towyn as good an education as in any of the public schools of England (hear, hear). Let them also remember that education was likely to keep an open door for them. It would prove to be a master key which would open very many doors and would enable them to find a living for them- selves in the wide world. He hoped they would value their education. He well knew what that school owed to the late Mr John Corbett, who had generously aided them through their difficulties and he for one fully appreciated his work. He believed they had got the most successful school in North Wales (cheers). There was another question which would perhaps arise in their minds and that was what were they working for with these county schools ? Where were they going to place all these scholars ? That was a question which would have to be left to themselves. They wanted to give them the best education they could get, in order to pre- pare them for the battle of life (hear, hear). They would enter different advocations and some of them would pprbap3 be politicians, and while speaking of politics he failed to see any reason whatever for the abolition of the County Governing Body under the new Education Bill (hear, hear). That body had, he maintained, done excellent work for the county, and what were they troiug to give them instead ? Well, it would be left in the hands of the County Council who would appoint a committee, which would be practically new to the work. He would suggest that they should reappoint the old body as its members (hear, hear, and laughter). They would find out th they had made a great mistake and after all the 1 i our they had gone through, the sacrifices which they had made to attend com- mittee meetings and so forth, it was just one little puff and all was over (laughter). Before conclud- ing he would like to refer to the excellent work done by Alderman H. Haydn Jones (applause). He complimented the managers on the work they were doing, and the great benefit which they were con- ferring on the community (cheers). The Rev R. R. Williams, in proposing a Tote cf thanks to Mr Wynn for his address, said that those who took interest in the affairs of the county knew of the great interest and work which he had done on bahalf of education (hear, bear). th\u00e8--m\u00f6tlouIn-a-tew appropnaLe worus j FCULLIU.

Mr Wynn having briefly responded, the conclud- ing acts of \"Maritana\" were proceeded with, and were much appreciated to judge by tLe applause at the happy conclusion in the last scene.

A communication, written by Lord Carlingford, addressed to Lord Aberdare, was read in reference to the constitution of the new college, but the subject was deferred to a future meeting. Principal Jayne proposed the following resolution: -That in addition to the principal, a second pro- fessor should be elected by the members of the senate as their representative on the council. After a short discussion this was carried. The council proceeded to consider the claims of the candidates for the position of principal, to which is to be attached emoluments amounting to P.750 a year.

In regard to each of these gentlemen, a volumin- ous correspondence, giving private and confidential opinions on, and the attainments and suitability of the candidates for the post, were read. The can- didates were called before the committee in alpha- betical order, and, after an investigation whichf lasted three hours, the council unanimously selected Mr J. Viriamu Jones, principal of the Firth Col- lege, Sheffield. Mr Viramu J ones is the son of the late Rev Thomas Jones, formerly cf Walter's-road Chapel, Swansea, and a brother of Mr Brynmor Jones, barrister-at-law, who Is attached to the South Wales Circuit. His school education was received at Univers'ty College School, London, and the Normal College, Swansea. In 1872, at the age of sixteen,he matriculated at the University of London. and at that examination he was placed first in the honours division. In 1873, at University College, London, he gained the first medals in the classes ot chemistry and zoology, the second prize in physics (first year's course) and an Andrew's prize for stu- dents of one year's standing. In the same year he passed the first board school examination at the University of London, and was placed on the first class in the honour- examination in chemistry. In 1874, at University College, London, the first prizes in applied mathematics, physics (second year'scourse), geology,mineralogy,philosophy of the mind, and logic were awarded to him and he also obtained the first Andrew'a prize for students of two years standing. In November of the same year he was elected to a Bruckeobury scholarship in natural science at Balliol College, Oxford. In 1875 he passed the second B.Sc examination at the University of London, and in the honours examination obtained the university scholarship in geology, and was placed second on the list ia logic and moral philo- sophy.

                "full_text": "The membero of the Swansea Edueatian Aafchoprty, lilt the monthly meatiag iio-day (Monday) wffl have placed before them the short liefc of six candidates, from whioh is to be chosen the principal of the Technical College. So far the lather has been treated \u00bb a sort of adjunct to the tntormedSate School. Henceforward, in a new broWing, upon wbioh about \u00a3 12,000 has been spent, the college is to have an entirely indepen- dent existence, with its own principal and teaching staff. Realising the importance of se- curing not only a competent headi, but, so far as was bttertanly poseSile, the best roau available for the oommencdng salary of \u00a3500 a year offered, the members of the Council, as the Education Authority, agreed to a proposal by which canvassing \u2022would be precluded from foisting Upon the ooikjge an inferior principal. This pro- vided that the names and qualiifcations of the sixty-three candidates shoald be pb.cei before throe education experts, Sir Harry Rochet (Prmoiptn of Bangor University College), Dr. Isambard Owen (Vice-C3ian- oelioT of the Welsh University), and Dr. Roberts (Registrar of the London Univer- sity), with a request tha.t they would de- note the six whom, in their opinion, ap- peared) best fitted for the post. Subse- quently there was a. change in this informal tribunal, Dr. Chatfcawav being substituted for Dr. Roberts, who disclaimed possession of any special knowledge enabling him to gauge the respective values in this connec- tion of tie varied scientific attainments of th-e candidates. In the result most helpful guidance was thus obtained, and the sub-commitibee had little more to do finally than to include in the six the candidates who bad received the strongest endorsement from tihe experts. In ail proba&lity it will be decided to in- vite the six to appear before the Council a.nd thus assist the latter in making the final eelection. Ac the college year begins in September, and August is a holiday month municipally, it is desirable that tlilll should not be deferred beyond the July meeting of the Council. The six candi- dates who have survived the procses off elimination are\u2014-(set out in alphabetical order:\u2014(1) Mr. Aifred Barnard Badger, aged 45, the present director of higher education tor Monmouthshire; (2) Mr. John Henry Grindley, Egremont, Cheshire, aged 36, until recently principal of the Higher College of Engineering, Egypt; (3) Mr. W. J. Linoham, Lee, London, 51 yeaTS of age, head of the Engineering Department at Goldsmith's College, London University; (4) Mr. W. S. Tempteton, aged 39, East Kirby, Notts, professor of physics in the Ceylon Medical and Technical College; (5) Mr. W. M. Varley, aged 31, principal of the Devonport Technical School and direc- tor of technical instruction for the borough and (6) Mr. J. H. Vincent, aged 38, head of the Physios Department of the Padding- ton Technical Institute.. With regard to their respective qualifica- tions and experience, Mr. Badger is a B.A. fOxDm.), with first-class honours in compara- tive anatomy and geology, and a. B.Sc. for research (Blrmingihani University), has been lecturer at various schools and colleges, and advieer in technical instruction to the County Councils of Carnarvon aind Merion- eth. Mr. Grindley took the B.Sc. degree in 1896, with first place in the first-claea honours, School of Engineering, Victoria University, tibe M.Sc. in 1899, and tfhe D.Sc. in 1902; was three years head of En- gineering Deportment, Huddersfield Techni- cal College three years head of the Applied Mechanics' Department, Liverpool Univer- sity, before receiving his Egyptian Govern- ment appointment (worth JE830 a. year, with house allowance, which he resigned in 1909. mainly on account of the unsuitabi li-ty of climate to wife's health). Mr. W. J. Line- ham hcids a B.Sc. in engineering (London University), and an Art Master's certificate (South Keffisixagton), and is the author of the \"Text Bock of Mechanical Engineering,\" a standard work, now in its eleventh, edition. Mr. W. S. Teropleton, aged 39, is M.A. (Glaegow), with highest honours in mathe- matics and naturai philosophy, and is a fellow of both the Physical atod the Chemical Society besides being Professor of Physics a.t the Ceylon Medical and Technical Col- lege, be. is the acting consulting electrical engineer to the Ceylon Government. Mr. M. Variey, aged 31; in 1899 took the B.Sc. degree (Leeds), with first-class honours in physics; the M.Sc. a.nd D.Sc. degrees (Manchester), D.Sc. (ad eundem) from Leeds University; after two years' course at Strasburg obtained the Ph.D. m physics as principal subject; was awarded the B.A. (research) degree at Cambridge, and subse- quently proceeded to the M.A. degree be- fore Devooiport appointment was yeans assistant picfessor of physics and electrical engineering at the Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh, Mr. J. H. Vincent, 38 years of age, is DJSc. (London), and bolds the re- search B.A. degree (Cambridge), as well as the M.A. of the same University; pre- viously to present appointment, which ho has held since 1903, he was superintendent of physical ctudies ait Downing College, Cambridge. It will be seen from the foregoing that in the matter of scholarly attainments, and even in that of teaching experience, the can- didates occupy a very high place. But, with one or two exceptions, their adminis- trative experience has been limited, and not one has specialised on lines fawuring the particular .requirements of a district where metallurgy offers the widest and roost fruit- fQ field for the labours of the stwtont. But, of course, a principal is a general dir- ector rather than a teacher, and the scholar, whose work has been varied in character, is usually capable of adapting himself and his special knowledge to the primary needs of the area from which the students are chiefly drawn.",

                "full_text": "Denbighshire Education Committee. UNJUST DISTRIBUTION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION GRANTS. A meeting of this authority was held at Queen Hotel, Chester, on Friday, the chairman (Mr W G Dodd) presiding. The standing orders were suspended to allow of Mr D S Davies bringing forward a matter of urgency and importance regard- ing the unequal treatment of Wales in grants for secondary education from the Board of Education. Hitherto, he said, grants bad been made on the same basing for both England and Wales; bit there was different treatment now under the new regulations. The grants were paid in England from the ages of ten to eighteen but in Wales the grants were paid only between the ages of twelve and sixteen. In Denbighshire they had thirty- one pupils under twelve, and they should lose, on these, E2 per head, and they had 195 pupils over sixteen, and on these they would lose 15 per head. Then they had 450 scholars from twelve to fifteen, upon whom they should lose \u00a31 per head, so that the total loss to Denbighshire was \u00a3 1,487. The differential treatment acted very unfavourably upon Wales, especially in low-rated areas.. He desired to call the attention of the Board of Education to the inequality of treatment, and with that object he moved That the new arrangement for the payment of secondary education grants operates adversely to the interests of the Welsh counties, especially those of low rateable value, and that representation be made to tha Board of Education to reconsider the basis of I allocation,\" Mr J E Powell asked was it because Wales had shown an interest in education second to none in the country that she was being punished in this way. He thought that because they had done so well they would have been rewarded with Well done, good and' faithful servant.\" They should have equal treatment to the rest of the country at any rate. Miss Gee Cannot we go farther and say that we ought to have twice as much (laughter) ? The Chairman was glad that Mr Davies had brought the matter forward. He did not suggest that the unequal treatment was a matter of design. He thought it was an oversight which the Board of Edu- cation would rectify when their attention was called to it. The resolution was then adopted. The following results of the annual examinations for the county exhibitions were submitted;\u2014 DIVISION A.

Mr J E Powell moved that exbibiulioiis of S30 each be Awarded to Charles Lewis Macgregor, Walter Pritchard Dodd, and Moulsdale Williams and exhibitions ofl \u00a3 25 each to Frank LewiB Heywood, and John Hazlett Mackie. I Mr George Cromar seconded, and re- marked that the fact that the four top exhibitioners were from Wrexham County School reflected great credit on that institution. H Mr F A Sturge observed that Mr Cromar was geperous in not pointing out that two of the winners of the eiliibitions had Scotch names (laughter). \u25a0 The resolution was adopted. 1",

                "full_text": "The Modern School. NEW LABORATORIES AT GRAMMAR SCHOOL AND TASKER'S. The modern secondary school is equipped on the most utilitarian principles. Excepting those pre- paring for the universities, the curricula now include instruction in physics and practical chemistry, woodwork, cookery, and botany. Boys must spend a portion of their time in the laboratory and the workshop, and girls are initiated into the mysteries of the cuisine. In the next generation flabby muscles and indigestion should be unknown symptoms. Both the Grammar School and Tasker's are now fully equipped with laboratories, etc., and are recog- nised as secondary schools. The Grammar School building is a commodious structure, 21ft. by 23ft., and has accommodation for 26 pupils. With over a hundred boys in the school, and with a very full time table, Mr Pile, the capable science master, is kept very busy, as are also his colleagues. All the forms, with the exception of the junior, have three hours' instruction each week, and there is also a weekly lecture of one hour's duration. At the present time physics and chemistry are the subjects taught. Later botany may be included, but for the present a full curriculum 'has led to the exclusion of this interesting subject. Up to the fourth form the pupils do physics entirely. There are two forms, the fourth and the fourth remove, who are taking the Central Welsh Board's elementary experimental science course, while the fifth form are taking chemistry for the senior course. It is interesting to learn that some 28 boys are to be presented for the elementary experimental science (Central Welsh Board), five or six boys T for mechanics, and 46 for the senior Central Welsh Board's certificate. One pupil\u2014R. Griffiths-who went in last summer for the senior examination, did exceedingly well in spite of the difficulties of teach- ing inseparable from the old laboratory. Up to the fourth form every boy takes physics and hydrostatics; afterwards the pupils take a more advanced course. If the boys going in for the Central Welsh Board examination are able to do well with the short course available, it will he a great tribute to their own industry and to the ability and energy of Mr Pile. The laboratory is furnished on the most up-to-date principles and leaves nothing to be desired. The light, though not brilliant, is good enough for the purposes required the lecture table commands a good view of the room, and the cupboards are exceptionally well stocked. Gas and water are, of course, laid on; the floor is made of wood-blocks, and the desk tops of teak wood. The store room can also be used as a dark room for photography if desired and should any pupils wish to take up this branch the necessary facilities will by-and-bye be granted them. Adjoining the laboratory is a carpenter's work- shop and upstairs are new commodious classrooms and a school library. Altogether the Grammar School Governors are to be congratulated on the new buildings, which were built by Messrs. Rees & Son, Narberth, according to plans prepared by Mr Hugh J. P. Thomas, architect. TASKER'S LABORATORY. The Tasker's laboratory is also excellently equipped. The desks in the new classroom are of solid oak, and the new buildings are heated by means of hot water pipes. The floors are of wood blocks, and the science room is well lighted and ventilated and furnished with all the necessary facilities. Instruction is given in botany, elementary chemistry and physics. Microscopes have also been provided to aid the pupils in their studies in advanced botany. The pupils experiment in various things including seed germination, thev are taught to observe the weather chart, and to record the changing conditions from day today. The new buildings are also furnished with a new cooking range, boiler, and cooking stove, and the pupils are taught how to prepare plain and simple as well as more elaborate dishes. Later, facilities in the teaching of cookery will be granted to the children in the elementary schools, so that the day is not far distant when every housewife will be able to cook. There is here every convenience\u2014pantries and scullery, an iron stove for the laundry work, and a new oak dresser. Geography is included in the science courses and some interesting work of the pupils is hung about the room, including some very good modelling of the Cleddau valley. The capable science mistress is Miss Edwards, and the cookery instructor is Miss Morgan.",

                "full_text": "THE NEW DIRECTOR. A DISTINGUISHED SCHOLASTIC CAEEKEt. Dr. James is ah evidence of the indomitable pluck and energy of a student who has, as Principal Roberta, of Aberystwyth, states, marked out for himself an extended plan of preparation, and steadfastly pursued it.\" He was born in Plasdoylan, in Conwil Elvet, Car- marthenshire, 31 years ago. After the usual course of elementary education he began the battle of life when twelve years of age, as a grocer's apprentice. in which capacity he served in Merthyr and Treorky. But after two years he returned to hie first love, and at the age of sixteen, having won a three years' exhibition, he entered the Cardiff University College from the Tetrad Higher Grade 8ebool, and there he was brought under the powerful influence of the late Principal Viriamu Jones, j Professor Koberts, and others. At the end of the third year he entered the normal depart- ment for two years. While at Cardiff he passed the London University Matriculation Examination in 1889, inter arta in 1890, and final B.A. in 1892; he was senior prizeman in mathematics in 1891, and prizeman in physical and commercial geography in 1892, he was placed in the first class in both years on the certificate list, and on the college sessional list he took a first class for theoretical and practical teaching. In mathematics he passed in the seven stages of the Science and Art Department before leaving college. Ile 'aloo passed in theoretical mechanics, honours; stage, in 1893. From October, 1892, to July, 1893, he attended, at Cardiff, the intermediate course of lectures, and performed laboratory work in physics, concurrently with studying higher mathema- tics. During the session 1893-4 Ile worked at practical biology and practical chemistry (each for six hours per week) in the Cardiff laboratories. From 1893 to 1896 he served as an assistant-master at the Rhondda Pupil Teachers' Centre, where he gained valuable experience in teaching, as well as in draw- ing up schemes of study in various subjects. He returned to Cardiff, and from there entered Balliol College, Oxford, as exhibi- tioner (open examination in mathematics), January, 1896; obtained the Goldsmiths' Exhi- bition, tenable for four years, within six months; passed moderations, first class, honours (mathematics) in 1896; final schools, second class, honours in 1899; studied advanced physics at Oxford from 1898 to 1900. Not content with reaching the top of the British educational ladder, he went over to Germany, and entered the University of Erlangen in October, 1900, and for over two years attended a course in experimental physics, mineralogy, and mathematics. In 1902 he obtained the B-Se. research degree (only awarded when a high standard of merit has been attained) at Oxford, November, 1902 He obtained the Ph.D. degree (Magna Cum Lauda) at Erlangen, December. 1902. Both these degrees were the results of examination, and of Theses submitted to the boards of examiners. Dr. James is a Welshman, and can k and write Welsh. At Oxford he was an active member of the Dafydd ab Gwilym Sooiety, and attended Prinelpal Rhyp's lecture* on the Mabinogion. He is also conversant with the French language and literature, and haa acquired much of his knowledge of physical science through the medium of that language. On the 10th of October he will be admitted to the M.A. degree at Oxford.",

                "full_text": "TALYBONT SUCCESS OF A NATIVE.\u2014The following extracts will be interesting to those who delight to watch the careers of successful young Welshmen called to fill honourable posts in far off lands. The Principal of the Presidency College, Madras, in his report to the Director of Public Instruction, dated 30th June, 1891, says There were ten students studying advanced physics in the senior B.A. class during the first term of 1890 and seventeen during the second term. It is to be hoped that the attempt which Mr Jones is making to familiarize the students with practical work in the physics laboratory will prove successful. Some physicists engaged in educational work in this presi- dency are of opinion that the time has not yet come when this subject can be worked at by students in the laboratory, and the scheme of the university has been drawn up on that understanding. The experiment made by Mr Jones is therefore one of the utmost interest in connection with the future teaching of physics in southern India.\" From the report it also appears that till now such practical work was im- possible owing to waut of materials, and that Mr Jones has been for some time engaged in the construction of various kinds of simple apparatus pending the arrival of consignments of suitable pieces from England. The facilities for electrical and magnetic work are now fairly good. Mr R. L. Jones, professor of physios and examiner in mathematics, is the son of Mr William Joues, of Pempompren-uchaf, near Talybont. THE POSTAL SEll.VICE.-Some of the inhabitants of Talybont most interested in improving the postal service have lately consulted together and have petitioned the Postmaster General to remove the hindrances to an earlier delivery and a later despatch of letters at Talybont. It is now understood that the rrail cart will, for the most part, if not entirely, be kept to the main road and so be able to arrive sooner and to leave later. The Talybont letters will, it appears, be delivered in a sealed bag from the train to the mail cart postman at Glaudovey and this will enable him to start at once to his journey instead of waiting some twenty-five minutes to sort and arrange. All letters leaving Talybont have now to be pcsted at the Post Office, and will not be receivable by the driver of the mail carr as he passes up the village. THE BETHEL DEBATING SOCIETy.-Last Saturday evening Mr T. H. Kemp delivered an interesting lecture to the members of this Society on Agricul- tural Chemistry.\" The Rev R. E. Jones presided and there was a large and attentive audience. The presi- dent spoke highly of the lecturer and characterized him as most active and willing to assist in every good cause, and also spoke of the deep interest taken by him in the general welfare of the neighbourhood. Mr Kemp,in the course of his lecture,showed that artificial fertilizers were of much more help to the farmers in these days than they might believe. Iu many cases manures improved the phys;cl and mechanical condi- tion and the texture of the soils to which they were applied. The experiments took very well. A hearty vote of thanks was accorded to the lecturer, prorosed by the Rtv W. T. Francis, and fecondej by Capt John Hughfs. SERIOUS ACCIDENT.\u2014On Tuesday week Mr Evan Lloyd, of Bryngoleu, met with a serious accident at Dolybont ta.ihome. By some meaus or other his foot was caught h the machinery. He was conveyed home, where he is progressing favourably under the care of Drs James, Turner,an Beddoes.",

                "full_text": "PHYSICAL TRAINING. It is impossible to over estimate the importance of early physical training, and, considering wo somewhat pride ourselves on being a nation of athletes, it is some- what surprising so little account is taken of this part of our education. True every school almost has its cricket and athletic clubs, and where opportunity offers, as at Eton and Westminster, its boat club likewise. But the joining these clubs is perfectly optional, and many a weakly youngster, who might growup intoa strong and hearty man, is left out in the cold from shyness or in- disposition to j oin in the sports. It is desirable, if only on the well-known principle of developing the mentcm sanam in corporesano, that every school in England should have attached to it one or more skilled instructors in physics \u2014not the physics with which the medical practitioner supplies us, or the physics which some reverend or irreverend wrangler does his best to instil into our feeble boy minds, but the proper use of the limbs with which Dame Nature has furnished us. This necessity is recognised abroad in countries which, athletically, are far behind us. In Germany and Holland espe- cially, whose cricket and rowing would raise a smile of mingled pity and contempt in the average English schoolboy, physical training is a part of the system. To nearly'every school a gymnasium is attached, and a high standard of proficiency in gymnastic exercises is pretty generally attained. A large section of our population habitually goes down to the sea in ships. Strong and deep rivers intersect our island in all direc- tions yet instruction in swimming is the exception rather than the rule. At Eton every boy must swim before he is permitted to enter a boat, but generally it is a fortunate accident if an English youngster shows any proficiency iu this manly exe cise. Gymnasia are seldom to be met with, and the belief is general that their erection must involve a serious outlay. But there is hardly a school in England at which the most important gymnastic appliances might not easily be improvised. A few ropes, a few bars, and a pole or two, with a gymnast to tesich their use, make up the mass of what is abso- lutely necessary, and anything more elaborate might be purchased by degrees. We trust the day may not be far distant when all our English youth shall be as well developed muscularly as we hope to see them men- tally. This may be done at a very slight additional expense, and the country should not only urge, but in- sist, on school boards making due provision for this im- portant part of our national education.\u2014Land and Water.",

                "full_text": "SOUTH WALES UNIVERSITY COLLEGE,, THE MINING SCHOLARSHIP. The usual monthly meeting of the council of the above college was held on Monday afternoon last, under the presidency of Lord Aberdare. The other members present were Messrs John Duncan, G. C. Thompson, 1<\\ B. Johnstone, Lascelles Carr, Dr. Edwards, the Revs. J. D. Watters, A. Tilly, and D. Evans. A suggestion from the Cambrian, Art Academy was referred to the general purposes committee for consideration. A formal vote of thanks was given to Mr W. Thomas Lewis for his very handsome olfer of a scholarship of jBSS par annum, open to colliers who have worked underground for six yeais in the Rhymney, Mertbyr, Aberdare, or Khondda Valleys. There has been correspondence on this matter between Mr Lewis, L >rd Aberdare, and the council. The original offer was made to\" Lord Aberdare in the following- letter :\u2014 Referring to our discussion as to mining scholarships when I had the honour of meeting you at the ittlieii. eiiiii Club a few weeks ago, I shall be glad, in order to give a, start, in the direction of establishing a chair of engineering and scholarships in connection therewith, to contribute \u00a3 33 per annum for six years towards a mining scholarship, the scholarship to be tenable for three years, andopen only to colliers of good character who have worked underground not less than six years at collieries in the Rhymney. Mcrtbyr, Aberdare, or Rbondda Valleys, As I believe you are aware, the at- tempts to establish provincial schools of mines have been anything but successful, but as I consider it very important for the future development of minerals in this district that special inducements should be offered to workmen's sons upon leaving school to enter collieries and make themselves thor- oughly acquainted with the practical getting of coal, I venture to malre this offer to assist in what will at all events be for some time bnt an experiment as regards its usefulness for colliery engineering, and in the hope that some of the mineral proprietors and large colliery owners of th.3 district will come forward and establish scholarships fcr the same object, and thus, if well received by the young colliers, ensure a good stock of practical colliery managers for the future working of our mineral field. Of course, if, will be necessary to consider some details as to arrangements for proposed candidates at- tending night school and lectures at the college to qualify themselves for competing for the scholarship and I assume that if such a scheme meets with the approval of your council, arrangements will he made so that the person holdiug the scholarship shall have h's education free of college fees. Perhaps I cup-ht to add that it may be worth considering whether two years at the university, and the third in connection with prac- tical engineering at a colliery, would not be better ihau spending the whole three years at the university. The matter was referred to a committee, who drew up a series of questions, and answers to those questions were received from a number of experts. Ultimately the senate prepared a scheme, which was submitted to the council and approved. The following arc the details of the scheme 1.\u2014That mining students to be eligible for the scholarship shall have worked underground at least six years. 2.\u2014That the subjects of the entrance examination shall be mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology, English, or Welsh. o 3.\u2014That the course of study shall be (first year) mathematics, physics, chemistry (. hemical laboratory), Kngiisii (short esr-ays), optional French or German. Second year\u2014\"Mathematics physics (physical labora- tory), chemistry (chemical laboratory), engineering, optional French or German. Third year\u2014Mathematics, engineering (and laboratory), engineering (drawing). It is hoped that the first examination will take place this side of Christmas. Other business, of no public importance, was transacted.",

OLD AGE PENSIONS.\u2014Our local post office now ex- hibits a public notice to the effect that forms of ap- plication for old age pensions will be obtainable on -4nd after September 24th. A NEW BOOK.\u2014The Rev. T .M. Phillips, of Mid- lleton, Manchester, is about issuing a very interest- ing and readable book, being a biography of the late Rev. T. Pennant Phillips, Horeb and Llandy- ssul. Mr. J. D..Lewis, .Gomerian Press, is entrusted with the printing. Such a book will be gladly hailed by a large number of readers. SUCCESS.\u2014We are pleased to note that Mr. Percy Williams, son of Mrs. Williams, Capel Mair School, has been exempted from the Lampeter Entrance Examination owing to a high standard obtained by him in one of the Oxford Locals. Mr. Williams was a student at Ystradmeurig, and we wish him every ^CJ^PEL SEION.\u2014It was decided at Capel Seion on Sunday last that the Three Counties Association should have their annual meetings m this town in June next year. The last time these important meet- ings were held here was in 1880. BAPTIST.\u2014The new Baptist Chapel at Penvbont is being nearly completed, and arrangements have been made to keep the opening ceremony on the 4th and 5th of November next. COUNTY SCHOOL SUCCESS.\u2014In addition to what is previously reported the following paragraph relat- ing to the extraordinary success of a. young pupil of this county school is worthy of consideration. In the Honours List of the Central Welsh Board results we notice the name of Miss Mary Hughes, Lianllwni, who has been placed 19th in the list ot the candidates throughout the whole of Wales. She has obtained the first place in the list of candidates from the four counties of Cardigan, Carmarthen, Merioneth and Montgomery and is therefore. en- titled to the \u00a320 Rendel bcholarship awarded to the pupil who attains the highest position in the list of successful candidates from all these counties, as well as to a County Exhibition. Considering that she had onlv just turned seventeen at the time of the examination her success is most exceptional and augurs well for her University career Such extraordinary results justify the praiseworthy re- marks made\" bv the public as to the progressive character of the Llandyssul County .chool Mr Lewis the headmaster, his colleagues, and this particular student, as well as the neighbourhood in general, have every reason to pride themselves nnon such a brilliant achievement. COUNTY SCHOOL.\u2014The results of the Central Welsh Board examinations have been received, and the long list of successes speak most creditably of the excellent, work that is being done in this school. During the last years the list of successes has con- tinually been a most exceptional one, and is most creditable; praise to both teachers and pupils. At the present rate of progress we shall soon be able to consider this school the very best one in the coun- try\u2014the percentage of successes being remarkably hi\u00b0-h. It may be distinctly noted that all the candi- dates who sat for the junior certificates did so after two years' training, which is the lowest limited time. Mary Anne Hughes, of Lianllwni, is to be heartily congratulated upon obtaining the Honours Certificate. Joseph Jones, of Rhydlewis, who sat for his junior certificate, obtained six distinctions in various subjects. Six of the candidates have passed so efficiently so as to have exemption from the elsh Matriculation. The total number of distinctions ob- tained by the scholars are 32. Mr. W. Lewis, M.A., had charge of the senior maths. Mr. D. J. Davies, B Sc. took science for all classes, and arithmetic and algebra for the juniors. Mr. Hudson took French and Latin. English was taken by Miss Roberts and Miss Evans. while Mr. G. Jones, B.Sc.. had charge of Welsh and Euclid for the juniors.

                "full_text": "A meeting of the council of the Bangor College was held on Wednesday. Mr H. Bulkeley Price in the chair.\u2014A\" resolution was passed with re- ference to the death of Sir Henry Tate, who was a life governor of the college, and had been a Z, generous donor to its funds, giving liberal assist- ance in particular to the scientific and technical' departments of its work.\u2014Out of a strong field of candidates, Mr Edward Taylor Jones, D.Sc., was appointed professor of physics, in succession, to Professor Gray. Dr Jones is a native of Denbigh, and won at the age of 14, from the National School, Denbigh, one of the scholar- ships of the North Wales Scholarship Associa- tion. After a course at thepropriet-ary School, Merthyr Tydvil, he entered the University Col- lege of North Wales in 1888, obtaining an en- trance scholarship. In 1892, he took the B.Sc. degree of the University of London, with first- class honours in physics, and second-class hon- ours in mathematics. The college nominated him to a Research Scholarship on the 1851 ex- hibition foundation, and he proceeded to the University of Berlin. Here, he carried on re- search work at the Physical Institute, receiving from the 1851 Exhibition Commissioners, at the end of his two years' tenure of his scholarship, a ,special renewal of it for a third year. In 1895, he embodied the results of his researches in a thesis on \"Electro-magnetic stress,\" for which the authorities of the University of London gave him the degree of D.Sc., without further exa- minational test. In the same year, Dr Jones became assistant lecturer and demonstrator in physics at the college, where he has since as- sisted Professor Gray in class and laboratory teaching.\u2014The senate announced that the com- mittee of the Liberal memorial to Mr Gladstone proposed to place at the disposal of the college a triennial prize of L5 in books to be given for proficiency in history, political science, and eco- nomics.\u2014A vote of thanks was accorded to the president, Mr W. Rathbone, for his gift to the college of a. portrait of the late Mr Mundella, with an inscription recording Mr (Mundella'S services to the cause of Welsh intermediate edu- cation.\u2014A letter was read from the Worshipful Company of Drapers, announcing that the com- pany would give JB200 a year for a period of three years towards the maintenance of the de- partment of electrical engineering, pending 'the establishment of the department on a permanent footing. The permanent buildings committee (upon which the, Bangor City Council is repre- sented) presented a report, offering for the con- sideration of the council several alternative schemes. It was resolved to submit the whole question to a special meeting.",

(chairman) presided at the monthly meeting of the Barry County School Governors on Wednesday last. The members present were Miss M. E. Meredith, Colonel J. A. Hughes, C.B., Rev. H. H- Stewart, M.A., Rev. D. H. -NVilliams, AI.A.. Messrs. S. R. Jones, J. R. Llewellyn, J. Mar- shall, Dr. P. J. O'Donnell. A SATISFACTORY REPORT. A report was received of the Central 1ft elslt Board examinations. The Chairman: You have the report before you. I think it is a very satisfactory one. Mr. Edgar Jones, M.A. (the headmaster) stated that he had engaged a teacher capable of teaching German, but he would have to confine him to French, because the staff was not large enough. Rev. D. H. Williams: Are there any chil- I dren who desire to learn German? I Mr. Jones: Yes; there are several. I SPEECH DAY. Mr. S. R. Jones suggested that in tuture it would be well to hold the annual Speech Day on Wednesday instead of Friday. it was agreed to bear this in mind next vear. I BURSARIES. I Several applications for bursaries were re- ceived, and in most instances the applications were granted. With regard to backward children, the Rev. D. H. Williams considered that to send any child back to an elementary school from the County School would be a tragedy. The Chairman suggested that the question of holding an entrance examination for ad- mission to the County School should be con- sidered This was agreed to. SCHOOL CARETAKER'S WAGES. A letter was received from Mr. George H. Cousens, caretaker of the Boys' County School, applying for an increase of. wages. It was decided to grant an increase of 5/- a week. PHYSICS MASTER APPOINTED. Applications were received for the post of physics master for the Boys' County School. Mr. Edgar Jones pointed out that one ap- plication was from Mr. A. Grant, B.A.. Huddersfield. second class honours physics (Oxon.), formerlv of South Wales. Mr. S. R. Jones moved that Mr. Grant be- appointed. Rev. D. H. Williams seconded, and it was carried. I MEDICAL INSPECTION OF THE SCHOOLS. Miss Lee. the headmistress, suggested that a system of medical inspection of the Girls.\" School should be introduced. Mr. J. A. Hughes said if it was important to have a medical inspection in the primary schools, it was more important in the secon- dary schools, but the question was that of cost; and it was decided that the Clerk write to the Board of Education enquiring the \u00a1 powers of the governors in the matter. THE SUMMER SCHOOL. On the application of the Director of Mu- cation for the county, it was resolved to grant the use of the schools for the purpose of the Glamorgan Summer School next year.",

                "full_text": "FISHGUARD COUNTY SCHOOL. GOVERNORS' ANNUAL MEETING. GRATIFYING C.W.B. RESULTS. The annual meeting of the Governors of the Fishguard Intermediate School was held on the premises on \"Wednesday afternoon of last week, when there were present the Revs W Evans, M.A., R.D., (vicar) and J W Maurice, Dr W Williams, J.P. (Drim), and Messrs T Lewis, J.P., William Jamts, and B Thomas (jeweller), together with the Princi- pal (Mr Owen Gledhill, B.Sc.), and the Clerk (Mr D W Lewis). In the absence of Mr J C Yorke, J.P., the chair was taken by Dr Williams. ANNUAL APPOINTM ENTS. On the motion of Mr James, seconded by Mr Maurice, Mr Yorke was re-elected chair- man. A similar compliment was paid to the Vice-Chairman upon the initiative of Mr Maurice, seconded by the Vicar. The Finance Committee was re appointed upon the motion of the Vicar, seconded by Air Maurice. On the motion of Mr Maurice, seconded by the Vicar, the Lodging House Committee was re-appointed. SEGREGATION OF SEXES. Arising out of this decision the Principal said that, on his recent visit, H.M. Inspector Edwards had enquired as to whether or not boys and girls were permitted to lodge on the same premises, and he had been able to answer that such was not the case. He had also enquired whether men lodgers were taken at the same houses as girl pupils. There was one instance where this obtained, and the Inspector had asked him to see that it should not be permitted in future. Some discussion ensued, during which it transpired that there was a tacit undeistand- ing that men should not lodge in the same houses as girl scholars, and that even in the case of brother and sister attending the school they lodged in different houses. The matter was referred to the committee responsible. REVISION OF FEES. Certain recommendations for the revision of fees were submitted by the Clerk and, approved on the motion of Mr Thomas, seconded by Mr Maurice. GRATIFYING C.W.B. RESULTS. The Principal presented the results in the recent examination conducted by the Central Welsh Board, remarking that, of the successes in the senior and junior certificates, many being very good, the majority being matricu- lation or more than matriculation, whilst thirteen distinctions had been secured amongst the seniors. The results were as follow :\u2014 Supplementary Certificate (raising last year's senior to a matriculation certificate] :-E R Jenkins and E A Francis. Senior Certificate (higher than matriculation, but does not qualify :-L May Burnnand- subjects: English language and English litera- ture (at higher stage) arithmetic (with distinc- tion) algebra, geometry, and trigonometry (with distinction) Latin, mechanics, :;nd physics.

Garfield Hughes would have qualified for distinction in arithmetic and mathematics had he got his certificate. The following,though below certificate stages, passed in cookery (Stage i) A H Haines, E M Harries, I G Nelson, E J Richards, and M L Thomas. EXTERNAL SCHOLARSHIPS. It was announced that the external scholar- ships granted by the County Council would fall to Dora Thomas, Letterston N.P. School, and Alice M Williams, and Annie Harries, both of Llanwnda Council School. It was decided that the Governors should grant similar scholarships to Thomas A Owen Stanley J Nelson, and Teify Kent Morris, all of Llanwnda Council School; also to Edgar M Jenkins, of Dinas Council School, and Sarah E George, of Llanychllwydog Council School. BURSARIES. It was reported that the County Council had granted a bursary to Phoebe Jane Evans. A protracted and involved discussion en- sued upon the advisability or otherwise of the Govervors granting bursaries during the ensuing twelve months. The question hin- ged upon the financial state of the school, and the debate was of so complicated a character as to render any save a verbatim report (for which we have no space) valueless. Suffice it to say that the proceedings were ultimately adjourned until the following Monday afternoon. i ADJOURNED MEETING. On the latter occasion there were in at- tendauce the same members as before save that the Rev J W Maurice and Dr Williams were absent, whilst Mr W L Williams was added to those present. Mr T Lewis was voted to the chair on the motion of Mr Williams, seconded by Mr Thomas. The question of bursaries was again gone into very fully, the Clerk reporting in detail upon the financial position and prospects and, after all aspects of the situation had been considered in detail, Mr Williams moved Mr Thomas seconded, and it was agreed, that the sum of \u00a3 \"12 be allocated for bursaries and augmentations during the ensuing twelve months. There was a large number of applicants, of whom the following were ultimately suc- cessful :\u2014William David John, Little New- castle William G Crutchley William Lewis, Manorowen David J Davies, Trecwn; Melville Fairhurst, Goodwick William Rees, Dinas Cross; Thomas Davies, Newport Olwen B John, Goodwick; John Wr George, and Ivor Phillips, Fishguard. b The scholarship of Sarah Ann Nicholas was renewed and the Principal volunteered amidst applause, to render the continuance of her augmentation, a first charge upon the special fund raised by entertainments for the improvement for the equipment of the school. REQUEST REJECTED. The Clerk read a letter Mr E J Head, art- ist, of 2, Marine Terrace, Tenby, asking for the Governors' views upon his offer to the Education Authority to accept a position as visiting art master to the Secondary Schools, of the county. Several membeis expressed the opinion that the finances of the school would not warrant it supporting the idea. The Principal voiced the opiniori that it would disorganise the time-table and re- duce the period of instruction at present de- voted to drawing. i It was decided that the Clerk should reply that the Governors* were sorry that they were unable to entertain the suggestion. INTERNAL SCHOt ARSIilPS. It was decided, after hearing the report of the Principal, to grant the following internal scholarships :-Class V, Sarah Reynolds; Class IV, Carrie Burnnand, and Gwladys Evans Class III, Willie Owen (Dinas); and Class II, Gwynne Gledhill.",

                "full_text": "County Director of Education. -0- Appointment Secured by a Fopmep Rhonduaite. Mr J. James, B.A. (London), B.A., B.Sc. (Balliol College, Oxford), Ph.D. (University of Erlangen, Germany), was on Tuesday appointed, out of 90 appli- cants, chief director of education for the county of Glamorgan. Dr. James received much of his early education at the Ystrad Higher Grade School, and he was for several years engaged as an assistant master at the Porth Pupil Teachers' Cen- tre. He was born in Plasdoylan, in Con- wil-Elvet, Carmarthenshire, 31 years ago. After the usual course of elementary i. iu- cation he began the battle of life, when twelve years of age, as a grocer's appren- tice, in which capacity he served in Mer- thyr and Treorchy. But after two years he returned to his first love, and at the age of sixteen, having won a three years' exhibition, he entered the Cardiff Univer- sity College from the Ystrad Higher Grade School, and there he was brought under the powerful influence of the late Principal Viriamu Jones, Professor Roberts, and others. At the end of the third year he entered the normal depart- ment for two years. While at Cardiff he passed the London University Matricula- tion Examination in 1889, inter arts in 1890, and final B.A. in 1892; he was senior prizeman in mathematics in 1891, and prizeman in physical and commercial geography in 1892, he was placed in the first class in both years on the certificate list, and on the college sessional list he took a first class for theoretical and prac- tical teaching. In mathematics he passed the seven stages of the Science and Art Department, before leaving college. He also passed the theoretical mechanics, honours stage, in 1893. From October, 1892. to July, 1893, he attended, at Car- diff, the intermediate course of lectures, and performed laboratory work in physics, concurrently with studying higher mathe- matics. During the session 1893-4 he worked at practical biology and practical chemistry (each for six hours per week) in the Cardiff laboratories. From 1893 to 1895 he served as an assistant master at the Rhondda Pupil Teachers' Centre, where he gained valuable experience in teaching, as well as in drawing up schemes of studv in various subjects. He returned to Cardiff, and from there entered Balliol College, Oxford, as exhibitioner (open examination in mathematics), January, 1896; obtained the Goldsmiths' Exhibi- tion, tenable for four years. within six months: passed moderations, first class, honours (mathematics) in 1896; final schools, second class, honours in 1899; studied advanced physics at Oxford from 1898 to 1900. Not, content with reaching the top of the British educational ladder, he went over to Germany, and entered the Uni- versity of Erlangen in October, 1900, and for over two years attended a course in experimental physics, mineralogy, and mathematics. In 1902 he obtained the B.Sc. Research Degree (only awarded when a, high standard of merit has been attained) at Oxford, November, 1902. He obtained the Ph.D. degree (Magna Cum Lauda) at Erlangen, December, 1902. Both these degrees were the results of examination, and of Theses submitted to the boards of examiners. At Oxford, 1898-1900, the, candidate read theoretical physics with Mr. Haselfoot, Fellow of New College, and worked through the com- plete honours course in practical physics at the Clarendon Laboratory under the supervision of Professor Clifton, F.R.S. At Erlangen, 1900-2, at the excellent physical laboratory of that university,, his knowledge of practical physics' was exten- ded (a) by performing a large number of advanced experiments in electricity and magnetism, and (b) subsequently conduct- ing an original research on electrical dis- charges, the subject being The method of MM. Abraham and Lemoine for the measurement of exceedingly small inter- vals of time applied to the determination of the velocity of electric discharge in an exhausted tube.\" During the interval from January to June this year (after taking the Ph.D. degree) Dr. James visited various schools and colleges in Germany, in order to learn from personal observation German methods of organisa- tion and instruction. As a, trained certi- ficated teacher, and possessing as he did a, fluent knowledge of the German lan- guage, he was impelled to, undertake this step alike on account of its enormous personal interest to himself, as well as the deeply national significance of the superior educational system of Germany. The permission of the Bavarian Kultus- ministerium (Board of Education) was ob- tained for this purpose, and the authori- ties of the schools visited were instructed from Munich to grant Dr. James every information and facility consistent with the regular working of their schools. Elementary schools (Volksschulen), inter- mediate schools of various kinds (gym- nasien, realgymnasien), technical schools, a technical college (Munich), and the uni- versity laboratories of Munich and Erlan- jen were thus visited, and numerous les- sons listened to. A special study was made of the training of elementary teachers, considerable time being spent at each of the training colleges and pupil teacher centres (or, rather, Praeparend- schulen) of Bayreuth, Bamberg, Altdorf, and Schwaba.ch. In this way Dr. James had ample opportunities of comparing the German and British systems in every re- spect (particularly so in the matter of the training of teachers) and of noticing, among other facts, the enormous stress laid in Germany upon (a) a systematic compulsory course of gymnastics in all schools; (b) how and why the absentee question in Germany has no existence; (c) what form of solution is given to the pupil teachers' school and training college question; and (d) how the different grades of schools present a harmonious, orderly educational structure. He has, more- over, during his stay of nearly three years in Germany, had repeated opportunities of discussing educational questions with university professors, secondary teachers, principals, and teachers of training col- leges and Praeparandenschulen, and ele- mentary teachers. He had the privilege of counting many of these among his per- sonal friends, and he was in an excep- tionally good position of acquiring an accurate knowledge of German educational conditions, while fully conversant with those of Britain. Dr. James is a Welshman, and can speak and write Welsh. At Oxford he was an active member of the Dafydd Ab; Gwilym Society, and attended Principal Rhys's lectures on the Mabinogion. He is also conversant with the French language and literature, and has acquired much of his knowledge of physical science through the medium of that language. On the 10th of October he will be admitted to the M.A. degree at Oxford.",

                "full_text": "Death of Principal V. Jones. BRILLIANT CAREER ENDED. Great Educationalist Gone. A great gap is created in Welsh educational circies by the unexpected decease of Mr. J. Yirinmu Jones, F.R.S., the weU-known and much-esteemed principal of the University Colitse of South Wales and Monmouthshire, Cardiff. Principal Jones had long' been a great BTIfferer-Ihe result of overwork in the interest of his college\u2014but some months ago hi., healtb 80 much improyed that he was able to resume his post. However, a week or two back the public were 6addened to learn that a relapse had taken place, and the principal was at once ordered away to Geneva, where lie passed away on Sunday. Principal Viriamu Jones was a thorough Cymro. and the son of a very remarkable man, the late Kev. Thomas Jones, so widely known and revered as the poet-preacher. The future principal was born at Pentrepoeth. near Swansea, January 2, 1856. and has, therefore, passEd away in the prime and fulneBs of his mannood. His name Yiriamu has often puzzled those unacquainted with the story of its origin. It was given him at his baptism out of respect for the memory of John Wil- liams. the\" martyr m;'8iollary'to Erromanga. The natives were unable to say Williams\u2014 Viriamu was their nearest approach to the <to them) unpronounceable name\u2014and the curious combination was bestowed on the young Jones, who has made it since so widely and so generally known. Young Viriamu re,eived his early training at Heading, from whence he passed to the University School. London, where he distin- guished himself by his great gifts and pro- nounced abilities. He afterwards studied at the Normal College. Swansea: matriculated with honours at the early age of sixteen: and went into liniversity College. London, where he remained from 1872 to 1875. Here his career was one of great success. In his first session he gained the first medals in the classes of chemistry and zoology, a second in physics, and an Andrews prize for students of one year's standing. In the sa.me year he passed the first B. \u00a3 c. examination, and was placed in the first class in the honours examination in chemistry. In the following applied mathematics, physics (second year's course), geology, mineralogy, philosophy of the mind, and logic, and he also obtained the first Andrews prize for students of two years' stand- ing in tbe faculty of arts and laws. or in the faculty of science. The latter prize is always given to the etudent who is held to have dis- tinguished himself most in the college exami- nations and by general good conduct dr,Iing the previous session. In 1875 Mr. Jones passed the second B.Sc. examination at the University of London, and in the honours examination obtained the university scholarship in geolog3-. ;md was placed second in the list- in logic aud moral philosophy. Prior to this, in the Kovember Qf 1874. he was elected to a Brackenbury Scholarship in Natural Science at Balliol College, Oxford, and in 1874-6 he was the pupil of Mr. Alfred Goodwin. M.A., pro- fessor of Greek in University College, London. With Mr. Goodwin he read the pass\" classical subjects which were a necessary pre- Uminarv to his scientific work. This gentle- man says of him :\u2014\" The open-minded interest and thoroughness of reflection which he brought to bear upon subjects apparently alien to his own specialism impressed me acuch at the time; and my belief in his love of knowledge of all kinds has been strengthened by subsequent intimacy.\" At the University of Oxford, in 1C77, Mr. Jones was placed in the first-class in Mathe- mstical Honours at Moderations: in 1879, in the first-class in the honour school of Natural Science (Physics). From October, 1880. to June. 1881. h\u00ab occupied the important post of Demonstrator in Physics at the Clarendon Laboratory, Oxford, and there proved himself to be an able physicist and a clever experi- menter. It will be seen that his career at Oxford was marked by the most eminent suc- cess, and we are assured by those who knew him that he was considered to be a leading man at Balliol, as well for his character as his abilities. Mr. J. St radian Davidson, Fel- low and Tutor of Balliol College, writes that the character that he bore was that of a man of vigorous intellect,, of enund industry, and of practical sense and energy. Mr. Davidson adds, \"Of all the Welshmen whom I have known in Oxford I should esteem you the best fitted for the headship of a college.\" Other gentlemen of eminence gave the same opinion, and it is true tbat when Mr. Jones left Oxford there were few if any men of bis age and standing who could compare with him in width and variety of scientific attainments. As wi11 have be-en observed ,he took highest honours in mathematics and physics, and it is stated that he exhibited great aptitude and originality in the study of both these subjects. Of the estimation in which he was held at the University College, London, the best testi- mony that can be offered is the fact that he was elected a Fellow in 1E79. On completing liis college course, and when only 25 years old. Mr. Jones was appointed Principal of Firth College, Sheffield, where he remained from 1881 to 1883, winning general respect for his high character and the thoroughness of his work. In the year last I mentioned Mr. Jones was elected Principal and Professor of Physics of the University College, Cardiff. and dnring tne past seventeen years has won golden opinions for his great ability as an organiser. Principal Jones, indeed, never spared himself where the interests of the college were concerned, and it may be said that he died a martyr for the institution so dear to his heart. Principal Jones found time outside his presi- dential duties to do some valuable original work in scientific research, and the Fellowship of the Boyal Society \",11icb was conferred upon him was accepted as a compliment to the Prin- cipality at large. It may lie added here that in his resarches the Principal found an able coadjutor in Mr. Harrison, whose departure from Cardiff was slch a loss to the College, where bjs technical knowledge was of such value in the experimental sphere. In 1882 Principal Jones maT1'ied Sarah Katherine, eldest daughter of M. W. Wells, of Wvlde Green. Birmingham. This highly- iccomplished lady has herself won general esteem by her efforts in the cause of social and educational progress, and her career as a member of the Cardiff School Board was one of much distinction. With Mrs. Jones in her sorrow the greatest sympathy will he feit throughout the Principality and far beyond its borders. It may be added that a younger brother of the late Principal is Mr. D.

Viriamu Jones, F.K.S., the well-known and much-esteemed principal of the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, Cardiff. Principal Jones had long been a great sufferer-the result of overwork in the interest of his college\u2014but some months ago his health so much improved that he was able to resume his post. However, a week or two back the public were aaddened to learn that a relapse had taken place, and the principal was once more ordered away to Geneva, where he passed away on Sunday. Principal Viriamu Jones was a thorough Cymro, and the son of a very remarkable man, the late Rev. Thomas Jones, so widely known and revered as the poet-preacher. The future principal was born at Pentrepoeth, near Swansea, January 2, 1856, and hae, therefore, passed away in the prime and fulness of his manhood. His name Viriamu has often puzzled those unacquainted with the story of its origin. It was given him at his baptism out of respect for the memory of John Wil- liams, the martyr missionary of Erromanga. The natives were unable to sa^ Williams\u2014 Viriamu was their nearest approach to the (to them) unpronounceable name\u2014and the curious combination was bestowed on the young Jones, who has made it since so widely and so generally known. Young Viriamu received his early training at Reading, whence he passed to the University School, London, where he distin- guished himself by his great gifts and pro- nounced abilities. He afterwards studied at the Normal College, Swansea; matriculated with honours at the early age of sixteen; and went on to University College, London, where he remained from 1872 to 1875. Here his career was one of great succesa. In his first session he gained the first medals in the classes of chemistry and zoology, a second in physics, and an Andrews prize for students of one year's standing. In the same year he passed the first B.Sc. examination, and was placed in the first class in the honours examination in chemistry. In the following session he was awarded the first prize in applied mathematics, physics (sccond year'a course), geology, mineralogy, philosophy of the mind, and logic, and he elso obtained the first Andrews prize for students of two years' stand- ing in the faculty of arts and laws, or in the faculty of science. The latter prize is always given to the student who is held to have dis- tinguished himself most in the college exami- nations and by general good conduct dning ths previous session. In 1875 Mr. Jones passed the second B.Sc. examination at the University of London, and in the honours examination obtained the university scholarship in geology, and was placed second on the list in logic and moral philosophy. Prior to this. in the November of 1874, he was elected to a Erackenhury Scholarship in Natural Science at Balliol College, Oxford, and in 1874-6 he was the pupil of Mr. Alfred Goodwin, M.A., pro- fessor of Greek in Univeraity College, London. With Mr. Goodwin he read the \"pass\" classical subjects which were a necessary pre- liminary to his scientific work. This gentle- man says of him:\u2014\"The open-minded interest and thoroughness of reflection which he brought to bear upon subjects apparently alien to his own specialism impressed me much at the time; and my belief in his love of knowledge of all kinds has been strengthened by subsequent intimacy.\" At the Univeraity of Oxford, in 1377, Mr. Jones was placed in the first-class in Mathe- matical Honours at Moderations; in 1879, in the first-class in the honour school of mathe- matics; and in 1880, in the first-class in the honour school of Natural Science (Physics). From October, 1830, to June. I 18S1, he occupied the important post of Detnonetrator in Physics at the Clarendon Laboratory, Oxford, and there proved himself to be an able physicist and a clever experi- menter. It will be seen that his career at Oxford was marked by the most eminent suc- cess, and we p.re assured by those who knew him that he was considered to be a leading man at Balliol, as well for his character aa his abilities. Mr. J. Strachan Davidson, Fel- low and Tutor of Balliol College, writes that the character that he bore was that of a man of vigorous intellect, of sound industry, and of practical sense and energy. Mr. Davidson adds, \"Of all the Welshmen whom I have known in Oxford I should esteem you the beat fitted for the headship of a eollege.\" Other gentlemen of eminence gave the same opinion, and it is true that when Mr. Jones left Oxford there were few if any men of his age and standing who could compare with him in width and variety of scientific attainments. As will have been observed, he took highest honours in mathematics and physics, and it is stated that he exhibited great aptitude and originality in the study of both these subjects. Of the estimation in which he was held at the University College, London, the best testi- mony that can be offered is the fact that he was elected a Fellow in 1879. On completing his collegfe course, and when only 25 years old, Mr. Jones was appointed Principal of Firth College. Sheffield, where he remained from 1881 to 1883, winning general respect for his high character and the thoroughness of his work. In the year last mentioned Mr. Jones was elected Principal and Professor of Physics of the University College, Cardiff, and during the past seventeen years won golden opinions for his great ability as an organiser. Principal Jones, indeed, never spared himself where the interests of the college were concerned, and it may be said that he died a martyr for the institution so dear to his heart. Principal Jones found time outside his presi- dential duties to do some valuable original work in scientific research, and the Fellowship of the Royal Society which was conferred upon him was accepted as a compliment to the Prin- cipality at large. It may lie added here that in his researches the principal found an able coadjutor in Mr. Harrison, whose departure from Cardiff was such a loss to the college, where his technical knowledge was of unique value in the experimental sphere. In 1882 Principal Jones married Sarah Katherine, eldest daughter of Mr. W. Wills, of Wylde Green. Birmingham. This highly- accomplished lady hat) won for herself general esteem by her efforts in the cause of social and educational progress, and her career as a member of the Cardiff School Board was one of much distinction. With Mrs. Jones in her sorrow the greatest sympathy will be felt throughout the Principality and far beyond its borders. It may be added that a younger brother of the late Principal is Mr. D. Brynmor Jones, M.P. for Swansea District, a man of bril- liant and versatile parts. Other children of the late principal is Mr. D. Brynmor Jones, their respective spheres: one of them is mar- ried to Mr. S.

The latter prize is always given to the student who is held to have dis- tinguished himeelf most in the college exami- nations and by general good conduct dt.iing the previous session. In 1875 Mr. Jones passed the aacond B.Sc. examination at the University of London, and in the honours examination obtained the university scholarship in geology, and was placed second on the list iu logic and moral philosophy. Prior to this, in the November of 1874, he was elected to a Brackenbury Scholarship in Natural Science at Balliol College, Oxford, and in 1874-6 he was the pupil of Mr. Alfred Goodwin, M.A., pro- fessor of Greek in Univereity College, London. With Mr. Goodwin he read the pass\" classical subjects which were a necessary pre- liminary to his scientific work. This gentle- man says of him:\u2014\" The open-minded interest and thoroughness of reflection which he brought to bear upon subjects apparently alien to his own specialism impressed me much at the time; and my belief in his love of knowledge of all kinds has been strengthened by subsequent intimacy.\" At the University of Oxford, in 1877, Mr. Jones was placed in the firat-class in Mathe- matical Honours at Moderations; in 1879, in the flrst-class in the honour school of mathe- matics; and in 1880, in the first-class in the honour school of Natural Science (Physics). From October, 1880, to June, 1881. he occupied the important post of Demonstrator in Physics at the Clarendon Laboratory, Oxford, and there proved himself to be an able physicist and a clever experi- menter. It will be seen that his career at Oxford waa marked by the most eminent suc- cess, and we are assured by thoae who knew him that he waa considered to bo a. leading man at Balliol, as well for his character as his abilities. Mr. J. Strachan Davidson, Fel- low and Tutor of Balliol College, writes that the character that he bore waa that of a man of vigorous intellect, of sound industry, and of practical sense and energy. Mr. Davidson adds, \"Of all the Welshmen whom I have known in Oxford I should esteem you the best fitted for the headship of a eollege.\" Other gentlemen of eminence gave the same opinion, and it is true that when Mr. Jones left Oxford there were few if any men of his age and standing who could compare with him in width and variety of scientific attainments. As will have been observed, he took highest honours in mathematics and physics, and it is stated that he exhibited great aptitude and originality in the study of both these subjects. Of the estimation in which he was held at the University College, London, the best testi- mony that can be offered is the fact that he was elected a Fellow in 1879. On completing his college course, and when only 25 years old, Mr. Jones was appointed Principal of Firth Coiiege, Sheffield, where he remained from 1881 to 1883, winning general respect for his high character and the thoroughness, of his work. In the year last mentioned Mr. Jones was. elected Principal and Professor of Physics of the University College, Cardiff, and during the past seventeen years won golden opinions for his great ability as an organiser. Principal Jones, indeed, never spared himself where the interests of the college were concerned, and it may be said that he died a martyr for the institution so dear to his heart. Principal Jones found time outside his presi- dential duties to do some valuable original work in scientific research, and the Fellowship of the Royal Society which was conferred upon him was accepted as a compliment to the Prin- cipality at large. It may De added here that in his researches the principal found an able coadjutor in Mr. Harrison, whose departure from Cardiff was such a loss to the college, where his technical knowledge was of unique value in the experimental sphere. In 1882 Principal Jones married Sarah Katherine, eldest daughter of Mr. W. Wills, of Wylde Green. Birmingham. This highly- accoanpliehed lady has won for herself general esteem by her efforts in the cause of social and educational progress, and her career as a member of the Cardiff School Board was one of much distinction. \"With Mrs. Jones in her sorrow the greatest sympathy will be felt throughout the Principality and far beyond its borders.

Viriamu Jones, F.R.S., the well-known and much-esteemed principal of the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, Cardiff. Principal Jones had long been a great sufferer\u2014the result of overwork in the interest of his college\u2014but some months ago his health so much improved that he was able to resume his post. However, a week or two back the public were saddened to learn that a relapse had taken place, and the principal was once more ordered away to Geneva,, where he passed away on Sunday. Principal Viriamu Jones was a thorough Cymro, and the son of a very remarkable man, the late Rev. Thomas Jones, so widely known and revered as the poet-preacher. The future principal was born at Pentrepoeth, near Swansea, January 2, 1856, and has, therefore, passed away in the prime and fulness of his manhood. His name Viriamu has often puzzled those unacquainted with the story of its origin. It was given him at his baptism out of respect for the memory of John Wil- liams, the martyr missionary of Erromanga. The natives were unable to say Williams\u2014 Viriamu was their nearest approach to the (to them) unpronounceable name\u2014and the curious combination was bestowed on the young Jones, who has made it since so widely and so generally known. Young Viriamu received his early training at Reading, whence he passed to the University School, London, where he distin- guished himself by his great gifts and pro- nounced abilities. He' afterwards studied at the Normal College, Swansea; matriculated with honours at the early age of sixteen; and went on to University College, London, where he remained from 1872 to 1875. Here his career was one of great success. In his first session he gained the first medals in the classes of chemistry and zoology, a second in physics, and an Andrews prize for students of one year's standing. In the same year he passed the first B.Sc. examination, and was placed in the first class in the honours examination in chemistry. In the following session he was awarded the first prize in applied mathematics, physics (second year's course), geology, mineralogy, philosophy of the mind, and logic, -and he-also obtained the first Andrews prize for students of two years' stand. ing in the faculty of arts and laws, or in the faculty of science. The latter prize is always given to the student who is held to have dis- tinguished himself most in the college exami- nations and by general good conduct dicing the previous session.

The annual collegiate meeting of the court of the University of Wales was held on Friday morning at the Girl's Intermediate School, Card iff. The senior deputy-chanceiior Isambard Owcu) presided over a large attendance, and in opening the 1,rOcp.e.Hngs he expressed (amid applause) the p^a-fure of the court at seeing Principal Viiiamu Jones restored to health. VOTES OF CONDOLENCE. A vote of regret at. the death of Prince Christian and of condolence with 1h Queen and Royal Family was passed on the motion of the Vice-Chancellor, -.be members of the GUt. standing in silence. The Vice-Chancellor then proposed a Tote of condolence with the families of the late Marquess of Bute, the late Alderman David Morgan, Professor Alfrtd Hughes. and Pro- fessor Armstrong. The Marquess of Bute was a profound scholar and a great patron of learning, and the university lost much by his death. They had always welcomed the presence of Alderman David Morgan at the court meetings as an evidence of the fact that th-sirs was the people's university anel was in touch with the people of Wales. The name of Professor Hughes had become a household word. He died at the post of duty, and tte-ey could not hep admiring the devotion to the Welsh Hospital in South Africa that he dis- played, and the skill and energy that he exerted in the work connected with the I hospital, which had attained E0 much l-epula. tion for proficiency and good work. The death of Professor Armstrong they regretted, as was one of their external exa-miiiers in science. WELSH HISTORY. Upon a letter from the council of the Univer- sity of South Wales and Monmouthshire, asking the court to draw up a detailed syllabus of the outlines of the history of Wales R.Sa. guide to teachers and examiners for the matriculation examination of the university. Dr. Treharne suggested that the executive should be instructed to draw up a -syllabus.\u2014 The Rev. J. Morgan Jones seconded.\u2014After dis- cussion, Colon-e I Pryce Jones proposed an amendment in favour of referring 1he matter to the senate.\u2014Mr. Tom John urged that this would shelve the matter until the next court. He proposed that instructions that a syllabus should hi) d.ra,fte\u00f9s]]o111d 00 s-ent. to the execu- tive eommit.te.e.-1.'his was eeconoed by Mr. Charles Morgan, and supported by the Rev. Aaron Davies and. several others.\u2014On being put. to the vote, Mr. Tom John's amendment was carried by 25 to fourteen. UNSATISFACTORY TEACHING. Professor D. E. Jones drew attention to the report, upon the examinations in dynamics, presented by Mr. E. H. Griffiths, who said :j\u2014 The candidates for degrees gave ample evidence of Ih careful and -ttho:-(.ngh training in physics which they had undergone during their university caieer; at tin' same timp. there were many failures due to a want of sufficient knowledge of thelemO(!ltary l10r\"ion of t'he subject, especially in those branches of physics which ars most clossly related to dynamics and statics. My study of the answers presented' by the candidates for the matriculation examination has ena.bled me to understand the causes of this deficicncy. I.. would appear as if the teaching of mechanics in the Welsh schools was most un- satisfactory. In no case have I been able to discover evidence of any experimental work whatever. The candidates appear to have learnt by heart a number of rules which tbey evidently regard' ae arbitrary without attach- ing any real meaning to such rules. Far example, they rarely failed to enunciate Newton's Second Law, but no candidate was able to giv-e an account of any satisfactory exparimental illustration of that law. Again, many candidates assured the examiner that gravitation did, not act in vacuo.' It would be easy to multiply such examples, and I am within tlo\u00fc, mark in .\u00a1;tating j.]\u00a1.(1t not rnor-e than 5 per cent, of the candidates showed any real knowledge of the subject. This position of affairs seems to me deplorable. It means that thoae undergraduates who ta.ke up physics for their final course must spend the first year at the university in an effort to acquire a knowledge of the most, elementary parts of that portion of physics without which further progress is impossible, and it is unfair to the university professors that tlhoirenegy should be expended in wor ko fthis nature.\" Professor Tanner said that. the explanation was that the subject was optional, and the students came very badly prepared. The teaching in Welsh schools in this subject was treated rather with contempt. The teachers were men, in many cases, who had no labo- ratory training, the necessary study in physics was not dealt v.ith as it should be. Physics were being driven out of the schools, and was not found to be a subject wo nil fol- lowing up. Professor Dofobi-? explained that it was felt that the students 'should not be hampered by a niultiplicit; of subjects. Professor Jones replied that that that was a strong argument, but if they were to retain the subject it and its corollaries should bo dealt with inore experimentally. Professor Chattaway urged that there should be more attention to the practical side of dynamics, physios, and chemistiy for the matriculation examination. Proff=sor Viriamu Jones said that the chief thing required by the examiners had been that the students should come to them well grounded in mechanics. The important thing for the university was that dynamics should be taught well in schools. There were diffe- rences of opinion between the central board and those dealing with the matriculation examinations. It was essential that the whole education scheme should be brought into har- mony. Professor Anwyl agreed with Professor Jones's last remark, and said that it would soon be necessary to re-consider the of the matriculation examinations in view of recent developments in intermediate educa- tion in Wales. A niotipn by Professor D. E. Jones was that the report of the examiner in dynamics should be referred to the senate, who should be asked to consider t.110 question of making dynamics an optional subject in matriculation and to re-consider the syllabus in dynamics. This was seconded1 by Professor Ohattaway, supported by Professor Lewis, and carricd. Professor Ohattaway moved that the 8.cnate should be a-ked to re-draft- the syllabus in chemistry.\u2014Professor D. E. Jones &ccondcd, and the court agreed. On the motion of Mr. T. W. Phillips, the vice-cbaneelior was asked to report to the next court meeting upo nthe manner in which oral examinations in Latin, French, and German could 00 made morc effective. Professor Anwyl 'haw many candidates to the matriculation examinations came from the intermediate schools. He was told that it was not more than 40 per oent. The Registrar could not tell the actual number, but said that there were not so many as last year.",

Girolamo Ponti, of Milan, by which he has bequeathed a portion of his property to the \"Academies of Science of London, Paris, and Vienna.\" It is understood that the re- latives of the testator intend to dispute the will, and as it does not clearly appear what British Society is indicated, the Secretary of State gives notice of the bequest, in order that those societies which may wish to put forward their claims, may take such steps in the matter as they shall think fit. The will, which is a remarkable one, contains the following passages relating to the bequest I dispose of the whole of what belongs to me on this day in favour of the three Academies of Sciences, of London (capital of England), Paris (capital of France), and Vienna (capital of Austria), so that my said patri- mony is to be divided amongst the said three Acade- mics, in equal parts (after deduction of certain charges). My patrimony consists for the greater part of mortages, and taking account of interest, amounts at present to 865,000 Austrian lire. Each of the three Academies above named shall be bound to invest in a perfectly we and profitable manner the third part of my patrimony which falls to its share, and with the proceeds to institute two annual competitions for ever, in equal amounts. Consequently, each of the aforesaid Academies will have to appoint a committee to decide upon the grant of the rewards annexed to the two competitions, which are to embrace the following branches: 1. Mechanics. 2. Agri- culture. 3. Physics and Chemistry. 4. Travels by sea or by land. 5. Literature. The object of the committee must be to give the preference to whomsoever among the competitors, that shall have advanced the sciences by the discovery of new and simple appliances, and this refers to mechanics, physics, chemistry, and agri- culture in regard to travels by sea and by lands whoever has distinguished himself by a long journey by land and by sea or has been able to make proposi- tions fitting to diminish the dangers inherent in the present systems, should have the preference in de- fault of inventors and distinguished travellers the committee will turn its attention to the most dis- tinguished publications of original works, or at least of translations from other languages of works upon the above mentioned sciences and travels, including litera- ture.\"",

Two lovers agreed to commit suicide at the same hour the other night. Next morning both were up an hour earlier than usual to look over the paper, and their disappointment and disgust at such conduct on the part of the other was too tieep for utterance. \"Dearest' The New Woman spoke affec- tionately to her delicate young husband.

                "full_text": "A MEDICAL SCHOOL FOR CARDIFF, la a memorandum which Dr Isambard Owen has prepared on the projected foundation of a medical school for Cardiff, the follow- ing occurs :\u2014\" It certainly appears to me that a great opportunity lies before Cardiff in the proposal to found a School of Medicine. Medical education in this country is by no means on a satisfactory footing. The students re- quirements are twofeld. In the first place he needs a sound academic training in the contributory sciences of physics, chemistry, biology, histology, physiology, and human anatomy. In the second ,lace he requires a wide field of clinical observa- ion in which to prosecute hi\", more strictly medi- cal studies. What Cambridge and Oxford have done for medical education, Cardiff may also do. The University College at present affords a full training in physics, chemistry, and biology. The infirmary, of 120 beds, is nearly the equivalent of Addenbrooke's Hospital, and has a much more important clinical field to draw upon. If a chair ot human anatomy and one of physiology and histology can be added te the college, and some provision made for instruction in materia medica, there is nothing to hinder Cardiff from carrying on, as the old universities do, the education of medical students in a thoroughly effectual manner up to the point of the first M.B. examination of the London University or the primary examina- tion of the conjoint board. If thi\u00bb can be done it will be a service, not only in Wales, but to medical education generally. Student life in a populous town necessarily offers many temptations to young men at the age at which medical studies are usually commenced. This evil is at its maximum when the student fiuds himself an unknown stranger in a distant city, among unfamiliar surroundings it is minimised when he is within reach of the restraining influences of relatives, friends, and home associations. I can wall understand that many a parent in South Wales would be glad for his son to commence his studies in a town where such influences may be available, and to proceed to tho metropolis at a later age, when some experience of life has baen obtained and the character is more firmly estab- lished.\"",

                "full_text": "Death of Principal Viriamu Jones. PREMATURE END OF A BRIGHT CAREER. We have to record with deep regret the death, at the early age of 45, of Mr J. Viriamu Jones, M.A. (Oxon), B.Sc. (Lond.), F.R.S., Fellow of the University College, London, the principal of the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, Cardiff, which took place at Geneva, Switzerland, on Sunday last. It is understood that Principal Jones's end was due to dyspeptic troubles against which he had been combating since 1899. Born at Pontreporth, near Swansea, in 1856, he matriculated at London University in 1872, and won a University scholarship in geology, a subject in which he graduated as B.Sc. with first-class honours in 1875. In the preceding year he was elected Brackenbury Scholar in Natural Science at Balliol College, Oxford and in due course he was placed in the first class iin Mathematical Moderations (1877) the final school of mathematics (1879), and the final natural science school (1880). For a short time he was demonstrator in the Clarendon Laboratory unde- Professor Clifton but in 1881 he left Oxford to become Principal of and Professor of Mathematics and Physics in Firth College, Sheffield. Two years later, on the establishment of the University College of South Wales, he was appointed its first Principal, also acting as Professor of Physics and this position he retained up to his death. In 1894 he was chosen a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1897 was elected a Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford. His scientific work was mainly concerned with the measurement of electrical resistance, and he was a member of the committee of the British Association on that subject. In particular he was deeply inter- ested in the determination of the standard ohm by the Lorenz method in absolute measure-i.e., condi- tioned only by the units of length and time and the properties of the ether he constructed a Lorenz apparatus for his laboratory at Cardiff, and took a prominent part in designing and testing another that was made in London for the McGill University. The cause of technical and scientific education in Wales owed much to his powers of organization, and he was vice-chairman of the Welsh Central Board for Inter- mediate Education, besides being the first Vice- Chancellor of the University of Wales. He was a brother of Mr Brynmor Jones, K.C., M.P.",

It was with envious feeling that local people received the announcement of the large profits made at the Cardigan eisteddfod last year, and in order, probably, to keep up courage the promoters of the Llandyssul eisteddfod a.so boasted of equal financial success.

The Corporation has come to the conclusion that the town drinks enough as it is, and that the municipa- lity ought, therefore, to give no countenance to any- thing, that would lead, to, the people drinking more whisky than they do at present.

In 1882, on the estab- lishment of University College, -Liverpool, he was appointed Professor of Physics, and this position ho has held ever since. Soon after he went to Liver- pool, he began to distinguish himself in the field of original scientific research. In 18S7 he was electcd a Fellow of the Royal Society, and a year later the University of St, Andrews conferred upon him the honorary degree of LL.D..

A DEAL has just been closed woereby a well-known brewing firm purchases about 480,0001b. of corks. This deal represents 4:90,000. In two years the company will deliver to the brewery upwards of 100,000,000 corks. This is said to be one of the biggest deals in corks ever made. These 100,000,000 corks in bulk, weighing 480,0001b., would support 240,000 men on top of the water were they to be thrown overboard, each with a single life-preservar on. MR. W. C. LAWTON pleads in the Atlantic Monthly for a wider recognition of the advantages of learning German, a language which, he says, should take the place of Greek in our high schools. He maintains j that a living language, fully known, can be more easily and thoroughly studied than the fragmentary records of an artificial literary dialect, long since practically dead. German is to-day, and must long remain, the chief instrument of utterance for the most advanced specialists in many fields of research. ^German, he adds, should be the first foreign lan- cuage studied in our schools.

The Corporation has come to the conclusion that the town drinks enough as it is, and that the municipa- lity ought, therefore, to give no countenance to any- thing that would lead to the people drinking more whisky than they do at present. Locally, the opinion has been expressed that they are not likely to drink any less until the Corporation will do something to allay the dust nuisance.\" PROFESSOR OLIVER J. LODGE, of University College, Liverpool, who has been appointed by the Crown to the position of Principal of the recently established University of Birmingham, was born at Penkhull, Stoke-on-Trent, in 1851 and studied at University College, London, where he afterwards became Assist- tant Professor of Physics. In 1882, on the estab- lishment of University College, Liverpool, he was appointed Professor of Physics, and this position he has held ever since. Soon after he went to Liver- pool, he began to distinguish himself in the field of original scientific research. In 1887 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and a year later the University of St. Andrews conferred upon him the honorary degree of LL.D. Professor Lodge is the author of several well-known works on scientific sub- jects, and is a leading authority on electricitv. A DEAL has just been closed whereby a well-known brewing firm purchases about 480,0001b. of corks. This deal represents \u00a3 90,000. In two years the company will deliver to the brewery upwards of 100,000,000 corks. This is said to be one of the biggest deals in corks ever made. These 100,000,000 corks in bulk, weighing 480,0001b., would support 240,000 men on top of the water were they to be thrown overboard, each with a single life-preserver on. MR. W. C. LAWToN pleads in the Atlantic Monthly for a wider recognition of the advantages of learning German, a language which, he says, should take the place of Greek in our high schools. He maintains that a living language, fully known, can be more easily and thoroughly studied than the fragmentary records of an artificial literary dialect, long since practically dead. German is to-day, and must long remain, the chief instrument of utterance for the most advanced specialists in many fields of research. German, he adds, should be the first foreign lan- [ fftiage studied in our schools.",

The habit was formed when first ha began to collect stamps, which require considerable skill and care in their arrangement. The duke is also proud of his books of newspaper cuttings, of which he has accumulated a large number. He has prepared an exhaustive index of their contents, and can quickly turn up any required extract. IN certain parts of Switzerland, when a young man is desirous to woo a maiden, he begs to be allowed to dine with her family on a Sunday. His offer being accepted, the lovers wait anxiously to see whether the ladys father will cause the cheese to be set on the table. At the end of the long meal, if all goes well, the master of the house solemnly fetches a cheese bearing the would-be bride's name, sets is on the table, cuts it, and gives a piece to the young couple.

                "full_text": "A MEETING CALLED IN LONDON. Lord Abordare's interest in the University College, Cardiff, is ever alive, and his influence may be easily gathered from the fact that a meeting in furtherance of the proposal to establish a department of medical sciences, or school of medicine, at the college is to be held under the presidency of his lordship, at the house of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, 20, Hanover-square, London, on Wednesday next. In a memorandum which Dr Isambard Owen has prepared on the projected foundation, the follow- ing occurs:\u2014\"Itcertainly appoars to me that a great opportunity lies before Cardiff in tbe proposal to found a School of Medicine. Medical education in this country is by no mean3 on a satisfactory footing. The students re- quirements are twofold. In the first place ho needs a sound academic training in the contributory sciences of physics, chemistry, biology, histology, physiology, and human anatomy. In the second place be requires a wide field of clinical observa- tion in which to prosecute his more strictly medi- cal studies. What Cambridge and Oxford have done for medical education, Cardiff may also do. The University College at present affords a full training in physics, chemistry, and biology. The infirmary, of 120 beds, is nearly the equivalent of Addenbrooke's Hospital, and has a much more important chmcal field to draw upon. If a chair of human anatomy and one of physiology aud histology can be added to the college, and some provision made for instruction in materia medica, thore is nothing to hinder Cardiff from carrying on, as the old universities do, the education of medical students in a thoroughly effectual manner up to the point of the first M.B. examination of the London University or the primary examina- tion of the conjoint board. If this can be done it will be a service, not only to Wales, but to medical education generally. Student life in a populous town necesearily offers many temptations to young men at the age at which medical studies are usually commenced. This evil is at iCe maximum when the student finds himself an unknown stranger in a distant city, among unfamiliar surroundings it is minimisad when be is within reach of the restraining influences of relatives, friends, and home associations. I can woll understand that many a parent in South Wales would be glad for his son to commence bis studies in a town where such influences may be avadable, and to proceed to tho metropolis at a later ago, when some experience of life has baen obtained and the character is more firmly estab- lished.\"",

The University of Wales has con- ferred the degree of doctor of science on Mr. Ezer Griffiths, late of Cwm- aman, and a native of Gadlys, Aberdare, now residing at Tedding- ton on Thames. He was born m 189, and received his early educa- i tion in \"YsgOl y Comin\" (Park School), under Mr. John Griffiths. I He won an entrance scholarship to the Aherdare County School, where he passed the London Matriculation in the First Division. He was suc- cessful in the Jntermediate B.Sc. examination and the C.W.B. hon- ours, gaining a distinction in Physics. He entered Cardiff Col- lege, where he took his B.Sc. and also obtained first class honours in Physics. The same year he won the Isaac Roberts Research Scholarship. The publication by the Royal Society of the young Welshman's work made a name for him, and in 1914 he was appointed on the scientific staff of the National Physical Laboratory, Since then he has been engaged on various researches connected with the war. Dr. Griffiths is one of a family of nine. One brother, Edgar A. Griffiths, has won distinction as a student of engineering, while: another brother, Arthur, is in the Secret Investigation Dept. of the j R.N.A.S. Dr. Griffiths' father and mother, Abraham Lincoln Griffiths and Ann Griffiths, lived some years ago at -3 Ann Street, Gadlys, where Ezpr was born. They afterwards removed to Cwmaman, and now re- j side at Cilrynydd.* He is an engin- eer, and when Ezer was a boy his father used to interest the children in toy engines and kindred things. The grandfather and grandmother. Ezer and Gwladvs Griffiths, lived at Highland Place, Aberdare. The former \\\\as known as \"Ezer y brie- man,\" and Gwladys was the inventor of the well-known remedy, Mrs. Griffiths' inflammation medicine.\" It is interesting to. note, further, that Gwladys' father, Thomas Jen- kill Arthur, built the bridge known to this day as Pont Sicnkin Arthur, at the bottom of Harriet Street, Trecvnon.

M. Louis Pasteur was born at Dole, Jane, December 27, 1822. and took the degree of doctor- in 1847. In 1848 he was appointed Profeissor of Physics at the Faculty of Sciences at Strasbourg. At the end of 1854 he was entrusted, as dean, with the organisa.- tion of the newly-created Faculty of Sciences at Lille. The year 1857 witnessed his re- turn to Paiis to undertake the scientific direction of the Ecole Normale. where he wAs educated. In December, 1863, he was appointed professor of geology, physics, and chemistry at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, and was elected a member of the Institute. The Royal Society of London in 1856 awarded M.
