The first of a course of ten lectures on Astronomy,\" in connection with the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, was delivered at the Royal Institution, Swansea, on Friday evening by Professor H. W. Lloyd Tanner. There were nearly a hundred persons present. The lecture was a general introductory one, and, being extremely interesting, was listened to very atten- tively. Professor Tanner, during his course of local lectures, will treat of the astronomy of the ancients, the astronomy of the sixteenth and seven- teenth centuries, and modern astronomy. It is intended, if a sufficient number join, to form classes, and to have examinations at the end of the course. The professor was assisted in his lecture by lime-light illustrations.",

Pickering, of Harvard University, is projecting a combination of all the observatories in the world, so that their capital can be combined into one trust. The astronomy industry, according to Professor (Pickering, has a capital of 10,000,000dols. and enormous incomes1. There are observatories with too many men at work, and there are some with too few. There are also places with big funds at their command and some needing money. The new trust proposes to combine the funds', and to distribute them economically, and see that the full value of the money is received. The pro- posed combination is international in character, and provides for all countries. According to the plan, Havard College would be the custodian of the funds, and would be the custodian of the funds, and would see to the distribution of the funds. .\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014",

Fullbrook, also a comedian, from continuing to present on the music hall stage a sketch called Astronomy,\" was before Mr Justice Phillimore on Tuesday. The ground on which the injunction was brought was that defendant's sketch was a crib from Mr Tate's sketch, entitled Motoring,\" which defendant denied. Mr JusticePhillimorerefused to assent to the contention of defendant's counsel that sketches of this kind were not within the law of copy- right. Defendant, when called to give evidence, ex- plicitly denied having in any way copied plaintiff's piece, and went at some length into the difference both in \"business\" and dialogue between the two pieces. He stated that Motoring was built up while he was engaged with Mr Tate, and that the suggestion of some of the characters and gags in the sketch originated with him. He admitted that he made up like Mr Tate when presenting his sketch, and told the audience that he would give them an imitation of Mr Tate, but said the resemblance extended no further. Most of the jokes in his piece were dependent on the presence of the telescope, as for instance, where the telescope is pointed towards a win- dow and be explains to the gazer That's Venus.\" On that an elderly man calls out, That's not Venus that's my wife taking a bath.\" A number of witnesses associated with the music-hall profession were called, and said that in thi-ir opinion the two sketches were quite distinct. Mr Justice Phillimore, in giving judgment, said he thought defendant had imitated plain- tiff's sketch, and granted an injunction re- straining defendant from performing Astronomy \"in such a way as to infringe plaintiff's rights. Judgment was therefore entered for plaintiff for 40s damages and costs.",

                "full_text": "DEATH OF PROFESSOR GRANT. T The death is announced of Mr Robert Grant, IjIj.u., .P.K.S., Professor of Practical Astronomy at Glasgow University. He was born in 1814, and was educated at King's College. Aberdeen, London, and Paris. During his reaidence in the latter city he attended the lectures of Arago at tho Paris Observatory, and also the lectures delivered by Le Terrier and other distinguished men of science at the Sorbonne. Dr Grant earlv acquired proficiency in the Greek, Latin, French\", and Italian languages, and likewise in mathe- matics. Returning to England in 1847, he de- voted five years to the completion of an elaborate work which had long occupied his atten- tion viz. \"History of Physical Astronomy. Published in 1852, it imme- diately gave its author a high scientific standing. In load he acquired experience in astronomical observation by a residence of some months at the Roya! Observatory, Greenwich and in 1859\u2014 upon the death of Professor J. P. Nichol-lie was appointed by the Crown Professor cf Astronomy in wn\"OW University. He proceeded to Spain in 1860, as one of the astronomers of the Himalaya Expedition, to observe the total eclipse of the sun. which occurred on July 18th in that year. On this occasion ho had the satisfaction of Jbtain- m a good observation of the scarlet sierra indi- cative of a continuous envelope encompassing the sun-of which he was the first to announce the existence in his History of Physical Astronomy,\" having been led to that conclusion by an indiic- tive inquiry based upon a discussion of all the eclipses of the sun recorded in history. ID 1883 he published a catalogue containing the mean places of 6,4-15 stars, chiefly teleseopic, deduced from observations made nnder h s direction at the Glasgow University Observatory from 1860 to 1881. This catalogue has been extensively used by astronomers in connection with extra- meridional observations of comets and minor planets. Professor Grant was for some years president of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow.",

Sir Robert Ball, F.R.S., Lowndes Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge University, unveiled a memorial tablet at Bath on Saturday on the house where Sir William Herschel discovered the planet Uranus. That event took place in the year 1781. Herschel communicated the tidings of his discovery to George III., and proposed to call the planet the Georgium Sidus, but the general body of astronomers preferred a classical name in keeping with the rest of the planetary nomenclature. Herschel as an observer has never been surpassed. The existence of binary stars, and the definite ascertainment of the revolution of Saturn's rings were among his achieve- ments.",

It is an attempt to pro- vide an inexpensive treatise which, while forming a stepping-stone to a practical acquaint mcewith the scenery of the heavens, gives, in simple terms, the results achieved by the latest research in those de- partments most, affected by the amateur. To this end Mr. Mee, an eminently safe guide we may say, has treated the subject unconventionally, and mathematics are eschewed, the author occupying himself chiefly with describing the aspect and physical condition of the orbs about us. Conciseness and accuracy have been the aim throughout, and the numerous refe- rences to other sources of infermhtion cannot but increase the usefulness of a little volume which, when read in connection with a good elementary tixt-book, will lay open the way for the student to become familiar with a more purely scientific treatment of astronomy as a whole. The author's style has considerable chnrm, and his presentation of his subject shows a clear conception of what is likely to be tppreciated, while, for the book itself, much has been done in the way of appearance, some of the numerous illustrations being remarkably good. It may alflO be mentioned that the work includes a memoir of the late Prebendary Webb, who did so much for observational astronomy. The notice is the fullest and best extant, and will nave especial interest for Welsh readers generally, because Mr. Webb lived and died at Hay, and to Cardiff readers in particular, because his father was once Vic <r of St. John's. In the preparation of his useful little work, Mr. Mee has had the advantage of being assisted by some of the best authorities living and a fact of no small impor- tance is that the book has been well printed, and the illustrations are unusually numerous and excellont. \"Observational Astronomy: A Book for Beginners.'

                "full_text": "\"OBSERVATIONAL ASTRO- NOMY,\" Observational Astronomy\" is the title of a book which will prove interesting, not only to the amateur telescopist, but to readers generally. It is just the book for a beginner, containing, as it does, a quantity of matter seldom, if ever, found in ordi- nary astronomical works. It is an attempt to pro- vide an inexpensive treatise which, while forming a stepping-stone to a practicalacquaintancewith the scenery of the heavens, gives, in simple terms, the results achieved by the latest research in those de- partments most affected by the amateur. To this end Mr. Mee, an eminently safe guide we may say, has treated the subject unconventionally, and mathematics are eschewed, the author occupying himself chiefly with describing the aspect and physical condition of the orbs about us. Conciseness and accuracy have been the aim throughout, and the numerous refe- rences to other sources of information cannot but increase the usefulness of a little volume which, when read in connection with a good elementary ttxt-book, will lay open the way for the student to become familiar with a more purely scientific treatment of astronomy as a whole. The author's style has considerable charm, and his presentation of his subject shows a clear conception of what is likely to be appreciated, while, for the hook itself, much has been done in the way of appearance, some of the numerous illustrations being remarkably good. It may also be mentioned that the work includes a memoir of the late Prebendary Webb, who did so much for observational astronomy. The notice is the fullest and best extant, and will nave especial interest for Welsh readers generally, because Mr. Webb lived and died at Hay, and to Cardiff readers in particular, because his father was once Vic.tr of St. John's. In the preparation of his useful little work, Mr. Mee has bad the advantage of being assisted by some of the best authorities living and a fact of no small impor- tance is that the book has been well printed, and the illustrations are unusually numerous and excellent. t \"Observational Astronomy: A Book for Beginners.'

The meet- inr\u00bb trOfi Ti olrl f 4-h.o. there was a good attendance. The lecture was illus- trated by a number of superb slides of the planets, the moon and other celestial bodies. During the last ten years, said the lec- turer, astronomy h\u00b0'-l ogress than any other science. 1\" \u25a0 i. 1 dis- covered that there are between 1,0!1(I ind 2.000 million stars. Each of these is sup- posed to be a world like our own world, in their cradles, and in the prime of thejr life. Astronomy traces the development of the star from a thjn. cloud-like matter that gradually cools. In its prime it has a temperature of 3.000 degrees centigrade. Much, more interesting data were given by the lecturer. who outlined the further cooling of the bodies until they Gink to the temperature of the sun, and even- tually cool. Examples of these three phases can be eoen in the moon-a goad world; 'Jupiter, in the intermediate stage; and the sun, in its stage of white heat. When the bodies become absolutely cool they might perhaps fall from their places an$by the impact another world is born. The chair was taken I* Mr. D. J. Morjan.",

ENTERTAINMENT.\u2014A pleasant and instructive enter- tainment was provided in the Zoar Chapel for the in- habitants of this place, on Tuesday evening the 20th instant, in the shape of popular lectures on the Holy Land, natural phenomena, and astronomy, illustrated by large and beautiful dissolving views. The views were hired from Mr. Cox, late of Skinner-street, London. The lecture on the Holy Land was delivered by the Eov. H. W. Hughes, Dinas, and those on the phenomena and astronomy, by Mr. J. E. Jones, British School, Dinas. As this entertainment was got up more especially for the benefit of the Sunday Schools, all Sabbath scholars were admitted on the payment of one penny each,\u2014the general price of admission being 3d., and reserved seats 6 J. The attendance was not large, probably from there being anniversary services held at the Independent Chapel on the same evening. As the means of spending a leisure hour in enjoyment as well as instruction are so meagre in this neighbourhood, a treat like the above should be considered a boon, and patronised accordingly. On Wednesday evening a \"imilar entertainment was to be given, consisting of a lecture on the Pilgrim's Pro- gress, to be delivered by Mr. H. Hughes, and illustrated in the same manner as on the preceding evening.",

Sir William Huggins, the eminent astro- nomer, died on Thursday a.t a nuTsing home in London after a day's illness. He was in his eighty-seventh year. Sir William was born in London, and edu- cated at the City of London School. His in- terest in astronomy developed at an early age, and in 1856 he built the private observatory at Tulse Hill from which most of his scien- tific investigations have been directed. Sir William was unquestionably the greatest liv- ing authority on spectroscopic astronomy, to which science the greatest part of his life was devoted. He was ably assisted in his re- searches by his wife, who collaborated with him in the Atlas of Representative Stellar Spectra,\" published four years ago. It is due to Sir William Huggins's inex- haustible patience and great ingenuity that we have learnt not only the constitution of the most distant stars, but of comets, which he has shown to consist largely of blazing carbon. The astronomer's work met with its reward. He was President of the Royal Astro- nomical Society from 1876-8, President of tha Royal Society from 1900-5, and President of the British Association in 1891. Most of all, however, he prized the fact that he was one of the twelve great Englishmen selected by King Edward as the original members of the Order of Merit.",

In fact, they differ almost as much as do water and wine. But the degree of difference varies.

I The priests of ancient Babylonia and Egypt were able t-o work miracles and pre- dict with accuracy future events, for they had a very considerable knowledge of astronomy, enabling them to forecast eclipses and other happenings in the skies. Where magic tricks were concerned, they had developed elaborate apparatus for just ouch purposes. Most jealously guarded was all knowledge of astronomy, and in this connec- tion it is worth remembering that the ancients .worshipped the sun, moon, and stars as gods. Many think that the famous Tower of Babei. principal among the temples of Babylon, was probably crowned by an astronomical observatory; and there seems to be good reason for believing that the Babylonian priests invented some sort of telescope. Knowledge of the mechanical arts was much more highly developed in ancient time-s than we are accustomed to imagine. The use of steam for power is considered a verv modern invention, yet it was so em- ployed long before Christ was born for operating trick machinery in temples, though only in a small way. In the temples of Greece and 5iome such machinery was an indispensable part of the installation. Re- mains of it sufficiently suggestive have been found in the ruit's of some of them. An early Greek physicist, not a priest, describes in detail the mechanical means by which many feats of sacerdotal magic were accom- plished.",

                "full_text": "THE LATEST IN ASTRONOMY. IT was the most natural thing-in the worl: for the President of the British Association to select as the subject of his inaugural address the science of astronomy and the rapid progress which it has made within the last twenty or thirty years. The name of Mr WNIXAJTF HTJGGIKS has long been almost a synonym for astronomy and its cognate branches, and the thoroughness and fresh- ness with which he handled the srubject last night only served to prove the great advantage to be derived from having the chair occupied by men famed for their knowledge of some particular branch of, science, and. permitting them to deal in their own way with their favourite study. It was no without some degree of reproach fulness that the distinguished President referred to the fact that his favourite science, had for a long timebeen excluded from the place of honour at the annual meetings of the Association. It-is, now one and thirty years since the late, Lord W ROTTESLEY occupied the-chair, andun. the interval be- tween then and now the whole afield of astronomical study-has been retraversed, re-surveyed, and, so to speak,, du up afresh, and made to-yield treasures, far be-- yond the most daring anticipations- of earlier times. The discoveries of ther, spectroscope, and the recent application of photography have almost revolutionised astronomy. The one has enabled'the observer to form what seemed to be-sound conclusions* as, to the composition of stars, planets, and other celestial bodies, while the photographic machine has afforded ,.suel\" accurate pictures of 'the firmament^and^of! the faces of some of: the'nearer^luimnarxes\"' uraimries- as to have added very materially to-.the,\" knowledge previously possessed. The-great; value of a good photograph isdts;perfectiqjif and the facilities which it offers -tot the observer when clouds or brilliant*; arm- shine prevent him from resorting to' the telescope and other instruments.- Not only so, but the photographic lens-sees, as it were, more than the assisted human eye is as yet able to-see. It prints upon the sensitized plate-stars which the most power- ful telescopes have not yet brought within the range of human vision,, so that the astronomer is now able to study the photo- graphs of many bodies of which he has not otherwise been able to catch one glimpse. In short, the spectroscope and the camera have become the gateways, to entirely new fields in the region of astronomy, and the fields which they have opened up are only be- ginning to be surveyed, so that there is: reason to expect that within the next' ten or twenty years other astounding discoveries, will be made. This is all the more remark- able, because, astronomy,- being the oldest of all the sciences, has often beenaupposed to* be the most complete. For centuries, we may' say, nothing was expected from a further study of i than perhaps the occasional dis- covery of some wandering comet or a planetary moon. The earlier astronomers had their own notions as to the composition of the heavenly bodies. Some regarded the sun as a solid body at a hieh temperature throughout others regarded it as a solid body which might be perfectly cool, but surrounded by an atmosphere of fire others, again, imagined it to be mere luminosity without solidity. The stars were generally handed over to the poets to get from them whatever description their unfettered fancy might choose to give them. Comets were taken possession of by some of the more fanciful theologians who deemed them fitting places for the departed spirits of the damned. The modern astronomer has already made, and is not unlikely to make still more, havoc with these strange fancies. The spectro- I p scope has gone far to prove the unity of the universe, or, in other words, to show that all the spheres have emanated from one source, and that they are linked together in one harmonious whole. In the address de- livered last night by Mr HUGGINS there was perhaps less of the poetry of the spheres than his predecessors in the chair would have indulged in. The brilliant bodies which shine in the sky at night are still to a large extent unknown. The most powerful instruments man yet possesses can only carry us a little way into the knowledge of what they are, but what has recently been discovered has, so to speak, brought them a great way nearer us than they were before, and has warranted discussions upon their constitution and their chemical composition in which previous occupants of the chair of the Association would never havedreamtofenter- taining. The great value of the address delivered last night is that it places upon record within short compass the exact position now occupied by the science of astronomy. Those who have not much time to devote to that brilliant study have only to read the address in order to have a tolerably accurate idea of what the astronomer has discovered, and those who take an interest in the science and have made themselves somewhat familiar with the principal discoveries of recent observers will readily unite with the President in the eloquent sentences with which he closed an address of great ability and of considerable beauty. Astronomy,\" said Mr HOGGINS, \"the oldest of the sciences, has more than re- \"newed her youth. At no time. in the past \"has she been so bright with unbounded aspirations and hopes. Never were her temples so numerous, nor the crowd of her votaries so great. Since the time of NEWTON our knowledge of the phenomena \"of nature has wonderfully increased, but man asks, perhaps more earnestly now than in his days, what is the ultimate reality behind the reality of the percep- tions ? Are they only the pebbles of the beaah with which we have been playing ? Does not the ocean of ultimate reality and truth lie beyond 1\"",

                "full_text": "THE LLANGEFNI SHAKESPEARE SOCIETY. The usual fortnightly meeting of the above society was held at the Cafe on Monday, the 25th of August. The subject chosen for tye evening was Shakespeare as an astronomer, on which an excellent paper was read by Mr Jenkins, the Bank, Llangefni. Mr Thomas, Post Office, was in the chair. Mr Jenkins, after a few preliminary remarks, said that the subject was a novel one, but withal an interesting and a thoroughly substantial One. Shaltepeare's claim to fair astronomical qualifi- cations was far from a pedantic one. On the whole, of course, it would be more accurate and consis- tent with fact to say that his astronomy had more sentimental than scientifi ccolourings. It would not be difficult for him with xis extraordinary powers of receptivity to assimilate the popular astronomy of his time; but astronomy at this period of its development was so hopelessly confused with astrology and superstition that it would be unfair to expect from him thorough accuracy in matters of detail. He was not equipped with the more modem weapons of Differential Calculus and Astronomical apparatus. His sphere in this department corresponded more nearly to that of Miss Herschel, who modestly described her share in the work of her illustrious brother, as \"minding the heavens.\" The music of the spheres\" is a very familiar and characteristic conception of the poet. It was probably originated by the great philosopher Pythagoras, that fountain-head of mystical and mathematical lore. It seems that Pythagoras was of a musical turn of mind, at least from a theoretical point of view, and went even so far as to suppose that the motions of the stars were set to music, and that their distances one from the other corresponded to the intervals between the different notes in what is known in music as the diatonic scale. Shakespeare gives expression to this highly poetic idea:\u2014 There's not the smallest orb which thou beholdest, But in his motion like an angel sings, Still quivering to the young ey'd cherubim. Shakespeare's universality of knowledge is proverbial. In his essay on Shakespeare, Emerson remarks that\" great men are more distinguished by range and extent than by originality.\" These qualifications are certainly present in Shakepeare. In his biographical sketch, Rossetti witnesses to this \"We have in him the technical phraseology of law, medicine, chemistry, navigation, music, necromancy, printing, and astronomy.\" In this connection he has one passage of special interest and significance: Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck, And yet, methinks, I have astronomy.\" (Sonnet 14) From the lines which immediately follow, it is quite clear that Shakespeare himself was not a believer in the vagaries of astrology, a science which was generally accepted as true in the dark- ness and ignorance that prevailed in his time. Proceeding, the lecturer gave a graphic and detailed account of the minutiae of Shakespeare's astronomical knowledge, comparing step by step his quasi-poetic observations with the more accurate and scientific knowledge of to-day. One quotation must suffice, one of the best known and most familiar stars is the Pole star. It was the great astronomer Thales that first recommended the use of this star in navigation, and for centuries it has answered every purpose of the mariner. Hence the Pole star became the emblem of constancy. This is evidenced by the following lines, On thine unaltering blaze The half-wrecked mariner, his compass lost, Fixes his steady gaze.\" And by the proud boast of Caesar in the Senate But I am constant as the northern star.\" But from a strictly astronomical point of view, the Pole star is not so fixed and unmoveable. In due time it must undergo a considerable change of position, and will be practically useless for pur- poses of navigation. Shakespeare again was fully conscious of the Reign of Law among the celestial bodies :\u2014Troilus and Cressida (Act 1. Scene III). \"The heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre Observe degree, priority and place,\" etc. To the student of astronomy, the references and observations of poets and novelists are more pop- ular and intelligible than accurate and scientific, and most poets are singularly unhappy in their speculations in this direction. Tennyson is an exception to this rule; but the exceptional accuracy of his astronomical ideas must be accounted for by something more than mere chance or coincidence. He must have been a very careful student of that science which provided him with so much inspiration. In conclusion, a most inter- esting and scholarly account was given of the substance of the great poet's references to celestial bodies and phenomena, stars, planets, sun and moon, together with a running criticism of the same in the light of subsequent research. To the poet, the lover, the musician, astronomy is one thing, and perfectly real. To the Astronomer Royal, to enthusiastic scientists, to men of figures, lines, and angles, astronomy is another thing, and equally real.",

John Jones, Abeinant, seconded he r's(\u00a1\u00a1utioI1, was supported by the Rev. J. II. Deft Williams, the vice- president of the Society, who referred to his usefulness as a member of the Cyrnrodorion Society. Last summer, when they went tor an outing to \"GwersyJ y Meibicn,\" Mr. George proved a very interesting guide to the mam- bers.\u2014The resolution was carried, oil the mem- bers standing. Mr- Powell then delivered an inter- esting address on \"The History of Astronomy and Welsh Astronomers.\" He pointed out that astronomy was one of the oldest of sciences, and one reason for that, undoubtedly, was that much of the science could be studied without the aid of any instruments. Many thought otherwise, and were of opinion that a telescope and an obsenratory were required for the study cf astronomy, but that wa\" not the case. Much could be done with the eye alone, with some strong common snse behind it (laught?r). This was proved by what the old astronomers had done. Mr. Powell then traced the way in which the constellations had been mapped out, and dealt with early astronomy, traditionally as well as in old historic documents; also the tes- iimonv of the ancient observatories, the PHIL\" mids, the heat-hen temples, etc. The constella- tions whicb known to the ancients wero known to people living above 38 degress north latitude. The names given to the con- steliations, too, showed that they were given by those who well knew the lion, the bear, the horse, sheep and goats, the bow and arrow, and the spear, but who did not know the ele- phant, the camel, the tiger, and the crocodile. They were not inhabitants of Europe or Asia, and thus must have been residents of Asia Minor\u2014Armenians\u2014along the banks of the Euphrates. The lecturer dealt with the careful manner in which these ancients traced the cclyptic through the signs of the Zodiac. In this connection he gave some interesting illus- trations of the references to astronomy in the Book of Job, and also dealt with the connection between astronomy and the \"Goreedd, as illus- trated by Stonehenge and other stone circles. He then dealt with Welsh astronomers, of I whom he gave brief histories. Robert Recorde (of Tenby) was one of the first to accept the Copernicus theory, who also issued the first arithmetic in English; and Sir William Lower, of Trefcnty, near St. Clears, and his friend, Mr. John Protheroe. Sir William Lower was the first- Welshman to use a. telescope, and I some interesting particulars of his lite were given. John Harris, a brother of Howel Harris of Trevecca, was also a diligent student of astronomy; and so was Nathaniel Piggot, of Llantwit- Major. Reference, too, was mad? to William Norbury, of Merthyr; the Rev. Mr. Webb, Vicar of Cardiff, father of the Rev. T. W. Webb, a renowned astronomer; Admiral Smith, scientific advisor to the late Marquis of Bute; Sir George Everest, or Brecon, and others. Eleazar Roberts, of Liverpool, still happilv alive, also had written a book in Welsh on agronomy. OtK-er living Welshmen were referred to who touk a deep interest in astron- omy, among them being Thomas William Jones (Arfonwyeon), as well as Mr. Edward Roberts, who bad taken a prominent part in the preparation 01 the \"N-nV-ical Almanactc\" T. E. Heath, Roberta, of Liverpool, and others. The lect/j-er then gave a very inter- esting account of various planets, and the way in which, with the aid of the spectroscope, composition of not merely the planets, but also the fixed stars, had been discovered. Some interesting p&n.iculars of the recent comet and of Hallev'r C.,U,\\C,t. brought a very interesting address to a cicm\u2014Al- interesting difcussron followed, in the 'iourse of which the Chairman, Mc65rs. J. Griffiths, E. Thomas, W. R. Wil- liams, R. Williams, and the Rev. J. R. Dewi Williams took part.\u2014On the motion ef Mr. J. Jones. Abornanfc, seconded oy Mr. T. J.

A preliminary meeting of friends of this movement was held at Paul's Schoolroom, Neville-street (by kind permission) on Fri- day evening. On account of the inclemency of the weather the attendance was small. Mr. Arthur Mee, F.RA.S., was voted to the chair, and produced a mass of correspondence with persons in various parts of Wales and Mon- mouthshire interested in astronomy, heartily approving of the society and identifying them- selves with the movement. The chairman also reported that the membership was already about 50 strong. The constitution of the society was discussed at much length, and. in the course of the evening, Mr. R. W. Atkin- son, B.Sc.. president of the Cardiff Natura- lists' Society, looked in, and expressed the svmpathy and good wishes of that body. Sub- iect to the approval of the general body of members, Mr. Mee was elected president, and Mr. N. Lattey, Dinas Povvis, secretary and treasurer. A committee was also formed, which will meet shortly to select vice-president, draw up rules, and complete the arrangements, prior to the holding of the first general meet- ing.",

The monthly meeting of the Astronomical Society of Wales was held on Friday evening at the University College, Cardiff. Mr. Arthur Mee, F.R.A.S. (the president) presided over an attendance which was small on account of the weather. Ten candidates were elected, and the Rev. T. H. Foulkes (uevonport) and Mr. T. H. Thomas, R.C.A. (Cardiff) were proponed for membership.\u2014Progress in various depart- ments was reported, and a hearty vote of thanks passed to the donors of various works to the library in course of formation.\u2014In the unavoidable and regretted absence of Mr. S. Home, LL.B. (who was to have read a paper on \"The Queen of Heaven\"), a, paper by Mr. G. P. Jenkins, F.R.A.S., was read on \"The New Astronomy.\" THE paper dealt lucidly with the wonders of the spectroscope, and was illustrated by lantern slides, exhibited under the direction of Mr. John Storrie.\u2014On the motion of the secretary (Mr. Lattey), seconded by Mr. C. T. Whitmell, M.A., a hearty vote of thanks was accorded Mr. Jenkins.\u2014The meeting then terminated, and the society will resume in September. In the meantime the \"Journal\" will appear monthly, as usual.",

At one time defendant worked with him, and he was with him when he was producing Motoring.\" Having heard the defendant was producing this piece, \"Astronomy,\" and that it had a singular resemblance to Motoring,\" he went to see it at the Hollo- way Empire on the 31st of March last, and at the conclusion of the performance requested d-efeadant to cease its production, as it was an mfringement of his right. .Mr. Walter Pink, who wrote the book of Motoring,\" also gave evidence to the effect that the pieces were practically iden- tical. Did you,\" asked Mr. Hohler in cross- emamtin-ation, laugh at any part of our piece?\" No,\" returned witness emphatically, I -was too much annoyed. I swore.\" The oaee was adjourned.",

                "full_text": "\"OBSERVATIONAL ASTRO- NOMY,\" \"Observational Astronomy\" is the title of a book which will prove interesting, not only to the amateur telescopist, but to readers generally. It is just the book for a beginner, containing, as it does, a quantity of matter seldom, if ever, found in ordi- nary astronomical works. It is an attempt to pro- vide an inexpensive treatise which, while forming a siepping-stone to a pructicalacquaii.tincewitlithe scenery of the heavens, give-. in simple terms, the results achieved by the latest research in thosH de- partments most affected by the amateur. To this end Mr. Mee, an eminently safe guide we m:iy say, has treated the subject unconventionally, and mathematics are eschewed, the author occupying himself chiefly with describing the aspect and physical condition of the orbs about Uti, Conciseness and accuracy have been the aim throughout, and the numerous refe- rences to other sources of information cannot but increase tho usefulness of a little volume which, when road in connection with a good elerneutary t-xt-boolf, will lay open the way for the student to become familiar with a more purely scientific treatment of astronomy -is a whole. The author's style has considerable Charm, and his presentation of his subj ct shows a clear conception of what is likely to be appreciated, while, for the book itself, much has teen done in the way of appearance, soma of the numerous illustrations being remarkably good. It may aLo be mentioned that the work includes a memoir of the late Prebondary Webb, who did so much for observational astronomy. The notice ia the fullest and best extant, and will have especial interest for Welsh readers generally, bocause Mr. Webb lived and died at Hay, and to Cardiff readers in particular, because his father was once Vic ir of St. John's. In the preparation of his useful little work, Mr. Mee has had the advantage of boing assisted by some of tha best authorities living and a fact, of no small impor- tunes is that tho book has been wall printed, and the illustrations are unusually numerous and excellent.",

Those who attended the course of University Extension Lectures on Astronomy last spring -will be glad to learn that the local Committee I have arranged for a course of six lectures on 1 Physical Geology\" to be delivered by the Rev. E. C. Spicer, M.A., P.G.S. (New College, Oxford), commencing on Monday, January xoth. As there may be some doubt as to what Physical Geology\" really is, it may be of guidance if we give the subject of the lecture as set out in the syllabus. Lecture I. deals with The Earth's Crust Lecture II., Earth movements Lecture III., Earthquakes and volcanoes\" Lecture IV., \"The work of water Lecture V., The work of ice Lecture VI., Scenery.\" The lectures (which will be illustrated) should attract large numbers, and will, we hope, be as great a success as the astronomy lectures. The following reports on the Astronomy Lectures and on the examination held at the close of the lectures, have been received by the Local Committee:- Lecturer's Report: It is satisfactory to find that the University Extension Lectures have met with so good a response after being- dis- continued for some years. The interest aroused was clearly shown not only by the numbers present at the lectures but also by those who stayed to the class. Six students sent in some good work regularly, and one of them made excellent use of a telescope in sketching lunar formations, while another made a telescope for himself. Those who organised the course may feel confident that they may embark on another next year with every prospect of success; especially if they emphasize the fact that the lectures do not by any means exhaust the whole opportunities offered the exceptional chance of personal guidance from an expert is probably of greater value than the lecture.\"\u2014J. A. Hard- castle. F.R.A.S. Examiner's Report: A good set of papers. All the questions (except number 6, the easiness of which was perhaps misleading) were answered well by at least one candidate, including the harder ones at the end. The candidates have made a real acquaintance with the sky, which should be a permanent possession, and I was glad to find them ready to discuss such matters as the Daylight Saving Bill.\"\u2014H. H. Turner, New College. The successful candidates were Evelyn D. Graham, Winifred K. Graham, Frank L. Raw- lins, Winfred Rose and Evelyn M. Whitehead. + \u2014",

                "full_text": "NOTES AND COMMENTS. THE establishment of an Astronomical Society for Wales is one of the signs of the times. We wish the society every success. Our ancestors were famed for their skill in astrology. They had names of their own for the principal stars and con- stellations. To them the Milky Way was Caer Gwydion, and the Cassiopea constellation was Llys Don. The old Welsh name for the Corona Borealis was Caer Arianrod, while the rainbow was called Bwa Arianrod. In recent times Wales has not contributed much to the science of Astronomy. There are a few names, however, which deserve to be mentioned. Far and away the most important is that of Arfonwyson, a young man from the hills of Eryri, who worked his way up to the second post in the Greenwich Observatory. His promising career was cut short by death in his iJoth year. Had he lived he would undoubtedly have attained to great eminence in the world of Astronomy. Dr. Rees (Gwilym Hiraethog) had paid considerable attention to this sciencs, and his lecture on it was at one time enormously popular. There are two Welshmen now living who enjoy a high reputation as astronomers. One of them is Dr. Isaac Roberts, a retired Liverpool merchant. He is a native of Holywell in Flintshire, but now, for climatic reasons, has taken up his residence in the South of England. The other is Mr. Kleazar Roberts, who for many years acted as chief clerk in one of the Liv erpool police-courts. He has written much on Astronomy for the Welsh magazines, and was one of the pioneers of the Solfa system ill the Princi- pality. Mr. Jenkins, a native of Cardiganshire, but now a Llangefni banker, is a younger student of the science, and has done much, by means of lectures, to popularise the results of recent research. Mr. Mee, of the Wtxlcrn Mail, who is I at the liCLid of the movement, will find himself supported from many and various quarters, and lie deserves all the success we can wish him. Should not there be also a Geological Society yn ngwlad y brvniau ?\" We clothe our hills and valleys with ) a halo of anient patriotism. The time has come to make them the subjects of scientific study. Even from a merely commercial point of view it would be a most desirable thing to initiate our young people into the mysteries of slate and coal forma- tions.",

Peter Price, B.A., Dowlais, de- livered a lecture on Dr. Barnardo\" at Bbenezer Welsh Cong. Chapel. The chair was occupied by Councillor L. N. Williams (Ap Carw Coch), and there was a good attendance. The proceeds were in aid of David Morris, 3, Clive- place, who, owing to illhealth, has been unable to follow his: employmenc for some time.

The wedding party and friends were en- tertained to brea,kfa6t at the bride's parents' residence. ASTRONOMY.\u2014On Saturday evening to a large and highly interested audience, Mr. W. R. Williams, B.Sc., of the Aber- dare County School, gave ail address on 'the above subject at the Public- Hall. Mr. Williams related the story of the heavens in a manner which was under- standable, entertaining, and instructive. He took. his audience on an imaginary lunar trip and showed by means of ex- cellent lantern slides, the wonderful craters and the tall mountains of the liiooii. A journey to Mars was equally interesting. Mr. Williams dealt briefly with the hypotheses concerning' the geo- graphy and population of the sister planet\u2014whether it was irrigated by means of canals, and whether it was in- habited by numan beings. The lecturer strongly advised his hearers to take up the study -of astronomy. They would -find-it an agreeable pastime and an in- teresting pursuit. Mr. Edgar Palmer was the lantern manipulator. On the T motion of Mr Henry_J<W M.E., Dyllae, seconded by Mr H- H- Evans, M.E., Bwllfa Mr. Williams was accorded the thanks' of a delighted audience, Mr. Williams, responding, moved a vote of thanks to the chairman, Mr Morgan Morgan, who is himself an enthusiastic student of astronomy. Mr. J. Prcwle seconded the vote, which was carried.",

                "full_text": "\"OBSERVATIONAL ASTRO- NOMY,\" a Observational Astronomy\" is the title of a book which will prove interesting, not only to the amateur telescopist, but to readers generally. It is just the-book for a beginner, containing, as it does, a quantity of matter seldom, if ever, found in ordi- nary astronomlca.) works. It is an attempt to pro- vide an inexpensive treatise which, while forming a stepping-stone to a practical acquaint nice with the scenery of the heavens, gives, in simple turms, the results achieved by the latest research in those de- partments most, affected by the amateur. To this end Mr. Mee, an eminently safe guide we may say, has treated the subject unconventionally, and mathematics are esqhewea, the author occupying himself chiefly with describing the aspect and physical condition of the orbs about, us. Conciseness and accuracy have been the aim throughout, and the numerous refe- rences to other sources of information cannot but increase the usefulness of a little volume which, when read in connection with a good elementary tixt-book, will lay open the way for the student to become familiar with a more purely scientific treatment of astronomv as a whole. The author's style has considerable charm, and his presentation of his subject shows a clear conception of what is likely to be appreciated, while, for the book itself, much has teen done in the way of appearance, some of the numerous illustrations being remarkably good. It may al,o be mentioned that the work includes a memoir of the late Prebendary Webb, who did so much for observational astronomy. The notice is the fullest and best extant, and will nave especial interest for Welsh readers generally, because Mr. Webb lived and died at Hay, and to Cardiff readers in particular, because his father was once Vicir of St. John's. In the preparation of his useful little work, Mr. Mee has had the advantage of being aasieited by some of the best authorities living and IL fact of no small impor- tance is that the book has been well printed, and the illustrations are unusually numerous and excellont.

The monthly meeting of the Astronomical Society of Wales took place at the University College, Cardiff, on Friday evening, and was tile best attended and most interesting that has been held since the formation of the society. The president (Mr. Arthur Mee, F.R.A.S.) occupied the chair. After the reading of the minutes, a number of candidates for mem- bership were elected, bringing the roll of the society up to about 120. A number of per- sons were also proposed for membership. It Was decided to defer for the present the engagement of an eminent astronomer to de- liver a lecture at Cardiff. Various donations of books were reported, and Mr. Patterson was appointed custodian of the society's litera- ture. A short notice of Mr. John Jones, Bangor, was read from the pen of Mr. G. P.

Mr. Chas. T. Whitmell, M.A.. was then called upon to read a paper on \"Recent Progress in Planetary Astronomy,\" which was delivered with lantern illustrations.

Readers who would care to join the society are requested to write to Mr. Arthur Mee, F.R.A.S,, 41, Hamilton- street, Cardiff. It is hoped to call a meeting shortly, when a programme will be decided upon. Meanwhile, readers would do well to note that, while the possession of a. telescope is desirable, it is by no means essential, all that will be required of members being that they should have an interest in the science.",

Mr. Arthur Mee, lecturing at Newport on Monday evening, on \"Are there Folk in Other Worlds,\" attacked some members of the Lon- don halfpenny press for the unscrupulous stuff they published on astronomical matters. In their feverish search for sensation they deliberately misinterpreted facts about (say; Mars or Satnrn, and said flippant things which deceived the multitude, but made the writers supremely ridiculous in the eyes of those in the know. Provincial newspapers were far more careful in these matters. The methods he alluded to were copied from America, where the cheap press never told the truth except by accident. As for some of the London halfpenny sheets, eight out of ten of the things they said about astronomy were false and the other two-tenths were garbled and exaggerated. This sort of thing did not hurt science, but it had a very had effect on the people at large and refcavftad advance of knowledge.",

That romantic astronomer, Camilla Flam- marion, pending that he arranges a system of planetary telegraphy between our Urania and Mars, advocates a new vocation for the superabundant fair sex. Recapitulating the marvellous discovery of Professor Huggins in spectra-astronomy, he asserts that the pierc- ing and patient eyes of ladies are eminently fitted for reading and photographing the messages sent. by stars we cannot see into prisms, whose light bands tell the threshold secrets of infinity. A French astronomer testifies to the aid he received from his bureau of young ladies he had employed to measure the photographs of the passage of Venus. There are in France 16,000 young ladies holding college diplomas seeking occu- pation, and who would ask nothing better than to he engaged either in c-lestial or terrestrial matrimonial duties.",

There ure hundreds of people in the dis- tricts named who take an interest in astronomy, and who would be glad of some common bond of union. If those who like to join an organisation such as I have named will communicate with me I shall be very happy to add their names to the already growing list. The posses-ion of a telescope is desirable, but not essential. Much can be done without it. The Society would, of course, embrace meteorology, ani it is hoped to work it on such lines as to make it interesting, as well as helpful, to all its members.-I am, &c., ARTHUR MEE, F.R.A.S. 41, Hamilton-street, Cardiff.",

It was reported at a meeting of the Pem- brokeshire Association for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments at Haverfordwest on Monday that Mr. Owen Thomas, the well- known London sculptor, had presented a memorial to Tenby Church of Robert Recorde. an eminent Welshman, who was born in Tenby about 1510. Recorde was the first original writer on arithmetic in English and geometry: he introduced the knowledge of algebra into England, was the first writer on astronomy in English, and the first person .in the country to adopt the Copernican system. The memorial takes the form of a portrait medallion. Reccrde was physician to King Edward VI. and Queen Mary, but died in prison in 1558.",

But, my friends,\" he continned, \"Vemis did not move one inch out of its course; and the earth did not move one inch out of its course, and\u2014there was no collision.\" These young men would be all the better if they were kept in that course where amongst other things they learn astronomy.",

TO THE EDITOR OF THE CAMBRIAN.\" SiK,\u2014Will you be so good as to insert the subjoined in your valuable columns, and so bring the claims of the new society before the scientists of Swansea ? There are many, doubtless, amongst your readeis who take an interest in astrouomy, or who possess small telescopes, and would like to turn them to account. The new society is intended to fill a gap which has never yet been satis- factorily tilled in England\u2014to do for the.amateur what the Royal Astronomical Society does for the more advauced or professional astronomer.\u2014Yours &c., ARTHUR MEE, F.R.A.S. Llanelly. THE BRITISH ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETL-This Society has been formed to secure the more thorough co-operation of astronomical observers throughout the country, and at the same time to meet the wishes and requirements of many, who, though taking a high interest in astronomy, have found them- selves precluded by one cause or another, from joining the Royal Astronomical Society. Its leading features are as follows \u2014Membership \u2014Open to all persons interested iu astronomy, ladies as well as gentlemen. Head-quarters\u2014o be fixed in London. Entrance Fee-Five shillings. This is optional ior all members joining before January 1st, 1891. Annual bub- scriptioiz -Half-a-guinea; or members may compound by a single payment of six guineas. Object-The association of observers, especially the posse sors \"f small telescopes, for mutual help, and their organization in the work of astronomical observation. The circulation of current astro- nomical information. The encouragement of a popular interest in astronomy. Methods\u2014The arrangement of members for the work of observation in sections, or departments of observa- tion, under experienced directors. The publication at short and regular^ intervals, of a journal containing reports of the Society's meetings, and of its observing sections; papers by members; and notes on current astronomy. The holding of meetings, not only in London, but also at provincial centres, wherever the number of members justifies, it, and the members themselves desire it. PROVISIONAL COMMITTEE.\u2014 T. W.

A certain Roman writer, who was librarian to Augustus Cseser, wrore a book on astronomy, in which he described Tripto- lemus as having been inspired by the goddes Ceres with the idea of extending the culture of corn in Greece. In order to enable him to travel rapidly from place to place the goddes obligingly provided him with a single wheel, across which he used to stride.

It is highly consoling to find a keener interest being taken in scientific studies in Wales. Seeing that the matter is seriously considered in the Welsh metropolis, it augurs well for the future success of this proposed scheme in furthering a practical knowledge of astronomy in the principality. By means of its recent achievements, Cardiff has recently surprised both neighbours and strangers alike. In Wales there are at present several symp- toms of a vigorous awakening in the wide field of science. Let us trust that there will soon be built an observatory which will be the pride not only of Cardiff, but of the whole of Wales.",

In none of the applications of photography to astronomy have the results been more immediate or more evident than in the discovery of the small bodies which move in orbits between those of MTars and Jupiter. From the observation of the first of these, Ceres, in 1801, until the end of 1891, 321 had been discovered by the comparatively laborious method of eye observation. From that time photo- graphy has been pressed into the service, and no fewer than 44 have been fouud within the last 15 months. Professor Charlois, of Nice, reports the finding of six during the last week, a feat which would have been considered unparalleled at the beginning of the century.",

The entrance age is twelve, and during the first three years all the lessons, four per diem, are obligatory, the chief subjects being the French language and literature, English and German, geography, arithmetic, elements of science, drawing and singing, with sewing and gymnastic exercises, twice a week; zoo- logy in winter, and botany, accompanied by botanising walks in summer. In the fourth and fifth years, French and modern languages, ancient history, astronomy, and cosmography, domestic economy, and animal and vegetable physiology are obligatory, while ancient literature, elements of Latin, mathematics, physics, singing, and drawing are optional. We thus perceive that France is now devoting as much attention to the solid education of both sexes as we are now doing ourselves.",

The phenomenon is not an imposing spectacle like a total solar eclipse, nor of such sensational interest as a transit of Venus but it has a considerable im. portance in astronomy of precision, and a certain popular interest as resembling a transit of Venus, which can never again be seen by those now living. The next transit of Venus will take place in the year 2004 hub there will be transits 01 Mercury in 1907 and 1914.\"",

SIR ROBERT BALL, who was lecturing this time last year in Cardiff, has just been elected to the Lowndean professorship of astronomy and geometry at Cambridge.

Nevertheless he is very lucid, and does not use words of whose sense he has only a faint glimmer, and his audience none at all. In his last book, The Cause of a Great Ice Age,\" he attacks his subject with transparent clearness. He prophesies the return of these Arctic conditions, but he does not specify the date. He stops short at that. Nevertheless here we are burning all our coal\" hen we shall want it later on.",

The Pig Fair was held on the following day. Mr. Hemming delivered his lectures on Astronomy and Electricity on Monday and Tuesday evenings in last week, at the Rutzen Arms Hotel. The audience we hear was of the thinnest, and but little satisfaction ex- pressed with the treatment of the subject.",

Dr. Percy Phillips, an ardent and distinguished astronomer, presided, and ably reviewed the usefulness of a local centre, the needs of the many gentlemen interested in astronomy, and the fact that there are at least a dozen Celestial glasses in the district, which, he thought, gave proof of the success of the project. A provisional council was appointed. A hearty vote of thanks to the chairman was proposed by Rev. J. Dynvant Wil- liams, and seconded by Mr. Caley. Mr. W. Beddoe was the convener of the meeting, which was highly successful.",

Taylor, H.M.I., F.R.A.S., Penarth, delighted his! auditors by his interesting facts relative to the celestial world. The lecture was well- illustrated by lantern-slides, and starting first by explaining the mechanism and working of a telescope, he afterwards gave an interesting summary of the features of the most noted of the bodies in space. His exposition of the comet formation-with special reference to Halley's comet was much enjoyed. The Society now has a fairly large membership, but all interested in astronomy are welcomed.",

The approach of the November meteor- shower will give the public at large an opportunity of doing a little observation which will not only bo interesting to those who take part, but even of considerable value to astronomy. Most celestial sights arc only to be properly observed by the aid of a telescope, but any person with average eyesight, ordinary intelli- gence, and a little trouble can do useful work in the recording of meteors. We learn that the Astronomical Society of Wales is organising a band of workers for the November shower, and we have no doubt there are many of our readers who would like, if pbssible, to do something towards the collection of results. It is to be hoped clouds will not interfere with the display of the 14tk-10th inst., which there is every reason to hope will be worth watching.",

I GENTLEMEN, Some time ago, I had my attention drawn to the subject of astronomy, by a vary learned and able Eriglish disputant, who has spent muoh time and money in the attempt to overthrow the theory, that the caith revulres upon its axes onoe in every 24 hours. It appears by the writings of the above learned gentleman, that the followers of Newtoa have no direct proof of the revelation of the earth. By much steady and indefatigable observation, I have discovered the most incontrovertible means of proving that the earth really doe. revolve from west to east. If I could have an opportanity of Illustrating my discovery in the presenoe of some scientific assembly, I should feel very happy in doing so, for the benefit of astronomical trtb. Therefore, I hope, Gentlemer, that you will use your influence to make this as pub io as possible. I remain, your'H truly, JAMES PRICE. Denbigh, November 9th, 1S70. \"'MES PllleE.",

There are few subjects with which people oannot familiarise themselves if only they take a little trouble. It ia not now, as formerly, a question of finance.

Professor Tanner, F.R.A.S., will give the first lecture of the series on Thursday night at the Cardiff Higher Grade Schools, and we notice that the public are cordially invited. Thus it is that all subjects, even in the heavens above, are brought easily and pleasantly within reach I of the people.",

Maidie Scott, wlfo is mcdestly described as \"just a. comedienne,\" greatly pleased the audience by the excellence of her oonrtributions. For an easy, unaffected, yet, clever, acrobatic display De Wynne Bros., with their dogs, would take a lot of beating. An item full of colour and movement is the soena Romps in a Drawing-room by the Kathleen O'Hanlon .Trio.Some of the wonders of the solar system are cleverly parodied by W. Fu lb rook and Co. in their comedy act \"Astronomy.\" A good variety entertainment is further enhanced by the doings of Bugler Oarr. a clever equilibrist and cornet player; Mike Nono, Irish come- di\u00d8in and dancer, and a series of good pdcitures.",

Conta (Newport), and A. A. Williams. A hearty vote of thanks was accorded the retir- ing president (Mr. Carslake Thompson) for his valuable services during the past two years, on the motion of Mr. Atkinson, seconded by Mr. Williams. Arrangements were made for a series of monthly meetings and short ad- dresses, promised by the followingMr. Thompson, The Leonids of 1899; Mr. Mee, \"How Big Does the Moon Look?\": Mr. A. A. W HHams, \"Biblical Astronomy\"; Miss Hagarty, \"Meteorites, Their Chemical Comprsition\"; the president, \"The Astronomy of Milton\"; The transference of the society's books to the care of the Free Library was discussed, and a committee formed to close the matter. It was mentioned in the course of the meeting, with regret, that, after seeking the advice of two members of the society, the Cardiff Town Council had gone directly counter to such in its selection of a final site for the Franklen Evans telescope, viz, the southern end of Catha,va Park, where the instrument wou'd be a mere peep-show, and its full powers never available.",

In a brief chat, in the bustle of the Lobby of the House of Commons, the member for Hoxton managed to tell his interviewer all about the origin of the idea and its development. I was always,\" he said, more or less mixed up in schemes for the improvement of women's education. Of course at that time women had no chance of approaching the Universities. A number of ladies also interested in the subject of women's higher edu- cation asked me, in 1867, to deliver a course of lectures to governesses on the method of teach- ing. Chief among these ladies were the members of the North of England Council for the Higher Education of Women, whose presi- dent was Mrs. Josephine Butler. I pre- ferred to give a course upon some definite subject, which might serve as a model for others, and Astronomy was the subject chosen. For eight weeks I lectured on astronomy once a week to these ladies at four centres, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, and Manchester, the number of students being about 600 in each place.\" This was the beginning, and after the ladies came lectures to working-men at Crewe and Rochdale, until in 1871, having worked out an organised scheme \"approved in actual practice as efficient,\" the pioneer and his friends were able to in- duce the University of Cambridge to appoint a com- mittee to give definite shape to the proposals. Such was the origin of the movement, in connection with which, during 1892-3, 931 courses of lectures were delivered, attended by 104,460 persons, under the auspices of the chief English and American organisa- tions,",

Not the least suggestive items were the photographs of nebulae, in which, assuming the nebular hypothesis to be correct, we can see steilajr systems in all the various stages of their life. When dead, they are dark. But may be the real value of soch lectures as these is that they arouse interest and lead on one here and there to that patient, continuous study which is necessary to ap- propriate for our own mental benefit even the faint glimmerings of knowledge which modern astronomers can give as to the in- finite universe of which we ourselves, our world, and our sun are inconsequential atoms'.

If a. volume of five hundred pages were produced somebody would have to decde which of the twelve thousand pages should be selected and which rejected and I am no judge of the relative worthlessness of what I write.

Huggins, F.R.S., on the subject of the instruments and methods of spectroscopic astronomy. Con- tinning his remarks upon the telescopes used for stellar work, the lecturer described the means bv which it was possible to evade the difficulties caused by their imperfect achromatism, and mentioned the new Jena glass, which was said to be per- fectly achromatic for the whole range of the spectrum. He proceeded to speak of the variations in construction necessary according as the spectro- scope was intended for the observation of a planet or nebula, which had sensible magnitude, or of a star, which had none. A description followed of the ultra-violet spectroscope in use in the lecturer's own observatory; this had an Iceland-spar prism and quartz lenses. A number of photographs of important spectroscopic telescopes were thrown on the screen and some of their chief features shortly noticed. The progress of our knowledge of the solar spectrum wai next briefly sketched and the achievements of the chief workers mentioned. Special attention was devoted to the apparatus and results of Professor Langley, who, by means of his bolometer, had been able to map out the lines existing in the dark part of the spectrum. The publication of his charts of this invisible region, which makes up three-fourths of the whole, Dr. Huggins said, were being eagerly looked forward to, not only as a matter of academic interest, but also because they would be of importance i4 meteorological predictions.",

The presenta-j tion of a large reflecting telescope, ajid the provision of aji Observatory, have Contributed largely to the success of th\", Society. For the public convenience the Ob- servatory situated at the top of Ty- newydd-iroad is open oin two evenings & week, namely, Wednesday and Satur- days, from 7.30 to 9 p.m., wet evenings excepted. On these occasions two mem- liefls are in attendance, one to manipu- ia,tp the instrument whilst the other de- 1 ivers a short address on an astronomi- bal subject. The result so far has been gratifying. It is intended on these oc- casions to cover as far as possible the whole field of po-pular astronomy. On Saturday, November 6th, a short history of astronomy was given, to be followed later by a paper on The Solar System,\" illustrated by dia- grams prepa;rod by the members them- selves. A number of visitors have nJ- ready put in an appearance on these evenings, and splendid views of the uioon and Jupiter have been obtained. iWhen viewed through a good telescope the effects are surprising to many, Especially the moon.

M. Krehmer was in perfect health and spirits on the previous evening, and his death is sup- posed to have arisen from disease of the heart. The deceased had only just attained his fifty-fourth year, Owing to the suddenness of the visitation, a coroner's inquest will be held. DEATH OF VISCOUNT ST. ViXCENT.\u2014We have to announce the death of the venerable Viscount St. Vincent, one of the three senior members of the House Peers. His lordship expired on Sunday morning last at Meaford-hall, his seat in Staffordshire, in the 93rd year of his age. DEATH OF PKOEESSOR NICHOL.\u2014Dr. Nichol, professor of astronomy in the Glasgow University, died on Monday afternoon from congestion of the brain. His last public appearance was on the 27th of May, in the City Hall, Glasgow, when he acted as chairman for M. Kossuth. The professor was born in 1804. His father was a bookseller in Montrose, and Mr. Nichol's first venture in life was as schoolmaster of Dun. in the neighbourhood of that town, when he was only sixteen years of He afterwards studied for the Church, and was duly licensed as a preacher. Literature and science; however, soon diverted him into a course more suitable to his faculties, Having obtained a professorship from Lord Melbourne's ministry, lie distinguished himself by his various popular works on astronomy, The Archi- tecture of the Heavens,\" The Solar System,\" \"The Planetary System,\" \"The Planet Neptune,\" &c.; and by\" his lectures on the same class of subjects, he was the first to make the public familiar with what is called the Nebular Hypothesis.\"",

Pleasure trips over to Norway are becoming more and more fashionable, and doubtless there is no more enjoyable way of spending a sum- mer's holiday. The Orient Steam Shipping Com- I pany have made arrangements for running two or three well-known ocean boats on these excur- sions during the present season\u2014the Garonne and the Chimbovazo, both of which vessels are fitted up with every modern luxury and convenience. To assist intending tourists an admirable pamphlet containing illustrations of the Fjords and picturesque mountain scenery, for which Norway is so famous, has been written for the I use of the passengers by Lieutenant George T. j Temple, R.N., F.R.G.S., and several contribu- tions on astronomy by J. Norma.n Lockyer, Kq F.R.S., and Grenville A. J. Cole, Esq., F.R.S., on astronomy and geology respectively. Such a pamphlet, we should imagine, judging from the copy forwarded us, should be an inestimable boon to the tourist who may be comparatively ignorant of the customs, institutions, and classical history of the Land OF the Midnight Sun,\" for it has been well sa.id that to know what to observe, when and how to look for it, and to be able to recognise it when seen is one of the most important qualifications of the traveler.\" The pamphlet describes the depar- ture from Tilbury,the configuration of the climate of Norway, the various points sighted along the coast, with illustrations of Bergen, Gudvangen, the Nserodal, Meraak, Molde, Romsdal, and Raft Sund, with admirable maps of the country, in eluding a geological sketch map. Tbe pamphlet is something more than an ordinary guide book, and would well repay anyone for its perusal.",

In the October number of that interesting little publica- tion, the \"Cambrian Natural Observer,\" the organ of the Astronomical Society of Wal(, Mr. R. Kenrick, of Aberystwit.h, contributes a short article which is written in Welsh on lunar eclipses. Nir. Kenrick is an EngHshman who has actiuired a knowledge of the language, and writes it in a way that puts many a Welsh- man to shnme. His article may be cited as a proof that Welsh is capable of ex- pressing scientific thoughts, though it lacks the precision ai:d fulness of English. It is by no means the first time, however, that an astronomer has made use of Welsh, as a reference to the excellent cata- logue of the Welsh department of the Car- diff Fre;, Library will show. The late Mr. Josiah Thomas Jones, 01 Aberdare, pro- duced a very big vs y ef a'r Ddaear\"\u2014a combination of astronomy and geography\u2014-in Welsh, and Mr. J. W.

(direc- tor of Wolsingliam Observatory, Durham) paid a v it to Cardiff on Tuesday, and delivered a lantern address before the Astronomical Society of Wales. Thcve was an appreciative audience at the Higher-grade School, over which Mr. James Waugh, M.A., presided. Letters of ajxjlogy for unavoidable non-atten- dance were received from the lie v. Canoa Thompson, Mr. J. Tatham Thompson 'president Cardiff Naturalists' Society), Signor Conta (Newport), &c. Mr. Espin's address dealt plea- santly with his observatory and its work, which, by the way, is entirely in the realms of sidereal astronomy. The history of the observatory was outlined, and then a series of slides shown deal- ing with discoveries among coloured and variable stars and stellir spectra. Mr. Espin held the close attention of his audience from first to last, but the interest was specially intense when he referred to an observation made a few nights back of an obscuring medium in R.A. 4h. 26m., N. Dec. 500 44\". The actual existence of this remarkable phenomenon has been abundantly confirmed. After the lecture a number of ques- tions were asked and answered, the participants being Miss Rule, the Pev. W. E. Winks, Mr. G. A. S. Atkinson, B.Sc., Mr. Norman Lattey, and Mr. Arthur Mee, F.R.A.S. A hearty vote of thanks to Mr. Espin was moved by Mr. Mee, who spoke of the honour conferred on the society and on Cardiff by the visit of Mr..Espin, whose name was a familiar and honoured one through- out the scientific world. The Rev. W. E. Winks seconded in a giaceful speech, and the motion was carefully adopted. The lantern was manipulated by Mr. G. A. Banting. Mr. Espin, daring his stay at Cardiff, was the guest of the Rev. W. E. Winks.",

Winks, F.E.A.S., read a charming paper before the Astronomical Society of Wales at the Y.M.CA.. on Wednes- day evening; subject. \"How I began to take an interest in astronomy.\" Mr. Norman juattey, the society's president, occupied the chair. At the outset there was some couversa- ^ejecent sun-pillar,\" in which the President, Messrs. Winks, G. Caralake lTiomp- Atkinson, and Arthur Mee took Part. The phenomenon had been reported by members of the society at Cardiff a ewport, and Llanelly. Mr. Winks' reminis- cences were related with much quiet humour, which the audience greatly enjoyed. He said he received his first astronomical lesson from his mother when a very little boy. Later on, in 1858, he made sketches a j ?J\u00abervations of Donati's comet, n i j t* them still. He strongly advised beginners to read all the works on astronomy they could, and to observe with the naked eye and thereby gain general familiarity with the heavens. Then when they ca^ne to purchase a telescope they would be in a position to properly appreciate the instrument. Mr. Winks' paper rendered his audience reminiscent, and the President told how as a boy in India his mother had pointed out to him Orion in all his glory; and Mr. Mee related his first astronomical experience when in 1866 his mother (who, he rejoiced to say. was still spared, and a member of the society) roused him from sleep to see the great star-shower of that year. Mr. Carslake Thompson also had some interesting memories, mainly of the comets of the fifties. He seconded Mr. Mee's motion that a hearty vote of thanks be accorded Mr. Winks for his delightful paper. Mr. Winks had brought to the meeting a beautiful little Dollond telescope, and Mr. E. T. Pritchard showed a small instrument which he had constructed himself, and which was examined with much interest by the members.",

                "full_text": "I STUDY OF ASTRONOMY SIMPLIFIED. I In an age when so much is talked and written about the value of education and its elevating influence, it seems hard to explain why so little attention is given to astronomy. Of all branches of secular instruction astronomy is surely the most sublime and elevating, and in the very nature of things it ought to have a special attraction for all who value knowledge for its own sake. No doubt, one explanation of the comparative neglect of astronomical studies is that they have not a high com- mercial value, and that in this commercial country youths or men who value knowledge for its own sake are in a very decided minority. We are inclined to believe, however, that this fascinating study would be much more generally taken up than it is were it not for a pre- vailing impression that no knowledge of astronomy worth having can be picked up without interminable re- search, enormously-expensive instruments, and special opportunities for investigating peculiar celestial phenomena. If it were commonly known what an amount of marvellous and interesting knowledge an attentive observer can acquire by the aid of the naked eye, and how largely that can be supplemented by the help of a cheap glass, even an opera glass, there would soon, probably, be ten times as many amateur astronomers as are now to be found amongst us. It is a slow and difficult task to persuade the public that the study of astronomy is not only a delightful pursuit, but also one open, in a large degree, to almost every moderately-educated man with eyes in his head. Of all who have endeavoured to popularise this delightful science, and interest young men in its cultivation, we do not know one who has laboured more disinterestedly, or who deserves greater credit, than Mr Arthur Mee, F.R.A.S., Cardiff, formerly of Llanelly. In addition to his writings in the Western Mail, his lectures before young men's societies, and other work of that nature, he has published some concise treatises, including\" Ob- servational Astronomy,\" which must have removed mountains of difficulty from the path of would-be students. His latest booklet, the smallest and cheapest of the lot-it is only 3 \u00a3 d.\u2014will probably do more than all the rest to multiply the number of star-gazers. This little work, which is named Observation without Instruments Hints for Young Watchers of the Heavens,\" is a rare compendium of information, advice, and suggestiveness. There is, in the form of frontispiece, a very striking \"Naked-eye study of the full moon,\" reproduced from the celebrated drawings by Eugene Antoniadi, of Paris: and this is followed by a series of chatty, simple, and untechnical paragraphs on The Points of the Compass,\" Apparent Movements of the Heavens,\" \"Day and Night-The Seasons.\" The chapter on \"The Constellations\" is a model of simplicity and brevity. A fifth-form elementary school- boy who reads it carefully should acquire the will and the power to make himself intelligently familiar with the aspect of the heavens and the more notable changes which come over it through the diurnal and annual motions of the earth. It is a great deal if one can only name and point out the principal constellations, and stars of the first magnitude, and this will be easy for every sensible reader of the chapter to which we are referring. The other chapters, which are as pithy, comprehensive, and instructive as the foregoing, deal with Stars, Clusters, and Nebulce,\" \"The Sun,\" \"The Moon,\" The Planets (what an amount of information about them in less than sixty lines !), Meteors and Comets,\" \"Eclipses, Conjunctions, &c,\" \"Meteorology,\" and Note on Small Instruments. We should like to see this little book widely circulated, especially as those who once read it will be sure to treasure it. Anyone who doubts this can judge for themselves by expending the small sum of 3id. We observe that the printers are Messrs Lennox Brothers, West Bute-street, Cardiff, but copies may be had direct, and post free, from the author, Mr Arthur Mee, Tremynfa, Llanishen, near Cardiff.",

                "full_text": "WELSH ASTRONOMERS. INFORMING LECTURE BY MR. ARTHUR MEE. I Mr. Arthur Mee delighted a large number of the members of the Cardiff Cynunrodorion I on Friday evening with an illustrated lecture on Welsh Astronomers.\" Mr. Mee said that, despite such note- worthy names as Principal Griffiths, Sir William Preece, and the late Richard Roberts, the great inventor, science wag not the Welshman's forte, the bent of his mind lying rather in the direction of religion, poetry, and metaphysics. Still, Wales had done something for astronomy, as he hoped to show. The recent study of Stonehenge a.nd other ancient monuments raised by our anoestors long centuries before Christ had oonvinced Sir Norman Lockyer that they were built with astronomical intent; and the speaker believed that the attainments of the anoient Britons both lD astronomy and astrology went even beyond the lines marked out by Sir Norman. One of the greatest names on the bead-roll of Welsh science was that of Robert Re-corde, a native of Tenby, who died in 1558, who was the first man in this country to embrace the Ooper- nioan system, the first to introduce algebra into England, and the first English writer on arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy. In the early years of the seventeenth century Slir William Lower and John Protheroe were in Cairmarthenshire making telescopic obser- vations contemporary with those of' Galileo himself. The eighteenth century produced a number of Welsh astronomers and mathematicians, including Rittenhouse, the American philoso- pher, who was of Welsh extraction. At the same time, there were lowly, but earnest, observers like Norbury and others at Mer- thyr, whose story had been so well told by Mr. Charles Wilkina. After referring to the former connection with Cardiff of those dis- tinguished astronomers, Admiral Smyth and the Rev. T. W. Wehb, and to the long scientific reoord of the Penllergaer family, Mir. Mee dealt with Afonwyson and other Welsh assistants at Greenwich, and then referred in turn to Mr. Eleazar Roberts, old John Jones, the working man scientist, of Bangor, and the late Dr. Isaac Roberts, tha.t great pioneer in the realm of celestial photog- raphy. The lecturer spoke of the Astrono- mical Society of Wales (of which he was the prinoipal founder) and the workers more or less closely identified with it. such as Arch- deacon Broce, the Rev. W. E. Winks, General Lee, Mr. T. E. Heath, the late Mr. Carslake Thompson, the late Mr. A. A. Wil- liams, the late Dr. Franklen Evans, Mr. Albert Taylor, Mr. Norman Lattey, Mr. Taliesin Jenkins, Mr. Ernest Madge, Miss Hagerty, and many others. Various por- traits and pictures of instruments were thrown upon the screen; also some of the pplendid celestial photographs secured by Dr. Isaac Roberts, who, it was mentioned, had remembered his fatherland in a prac- tical way by leaving a princely sum to be divided between the University Colleges of Cardiff, Bangor, and Liverpool. In proposing a vote of thanks to Mr. Mee. Dr. Prichard, vice-president of the society, referred to him as the most versatile mem- ber of the society, and incidentally suggested that Mr. Mee should paiblish in book form tihe poetical sketches which appear froan time to time, in \"Wales Day by Day\" in the Western Mail.\"",

                "full_text": "THE APPROACHING TRANSIT OF MERCURY. Mr. H. H. Turner, Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, wrote last week to the papers pointing out the present facilities for proceeding to America should any enthusiastic astronomical amateurs desire to do so in order to observe the transit of the planet Mercury over the sun's disc which will occur on the 10th of November next, but can be seen only very partially in this country, as the sun will set at Green- wich little more than a quarter of an hour after the Shenomenon has commenced. It will (observes Mr. V. T. Lynn, B.A., F.R.A.S., writing intheifcAo) be 10 years before another occurs, and it may be of interest to recall to mind those which took place when telescopic astronomy was in its infancy. The first ever seen was predicted by the illustrious Kepler w about to take place on the 7th of November, 1631, and was observed by Gassendi at Pai is, though the Sun was from time to time obscured by clouds which effectually prevented the Professor of Astronomy at Amsterdam from seeing it at all. Kepler himself had been gathered to his fathers the year before. He had predicted, also, a transit of Venus, to take place about a month after that of Mercury, which was not seen, as it occurred whilst it was night in Europe. One which took place eight years afterwards was, as is well known, observed by Horrox and his friend Crabtree in Lancashire. Those of Mercury occur more frequently on the whole, but the next after 1631 was in 1644, and could not be seen. The next was due on the 3rd November, 1651, and an enthusiastic young Englishman named Jeremiah Shakerley, finding it could not be seen in Europe, travelled to Surat in India for the purpose of seeing it. Nearly 10 years later, on the 3rd of May, 1661, another took place, which was partially observed by several astronomers, both England and on the Continent. But the first, which was watched all through from be- ginning to end, was that of the 7th of November. 1677, observed by Halley (who, more than 40 years afterwards, became the second Astronomer Royal in succession to Flamsteed) at St. Helena, whither he had gone to observe the stars of the Southern Hemi- sphere. It was this observation which led him to suggest those of future transits of Venus as the best means of determining the distance of the Sun; that planet coming on those occasions very much nearer ua than any other. This does not apply to Mercury, which when nearest is more than double the distance of Venus in the same position the phenomenon, however, is of considerable interest in itself, so that the position of that of November 10 next, visible in this country (just before sunset) will be eagerly looked for by those possessed of moderate telescopes, and in America, in places where the sky is clear, an oppor- tunity will be afforded of witnessing the whole.",

CHURCH HISTORY.\u2014Continuing the course, on Tuesday evening, the class discussed the period and events which led up to the reformation, the president shewing from the text book and other sources that the reformation was not the act of of Henry VI LIt but was the outcome of the feel- ing and wish of the people and of the church, as shown by the action of Convocation, and that Henry was only one actor, and by no means the chief in the great events that transpired. The reformation on the Continent, originated by Calvin and others, was touched npon, and its bearing and influence on the English Church considered. Next week s discussion will be on the suppression of the monasteries and the results.

It may be mentioned as an interest- ing fact that he preachcd his first sermon in St David's Church, in Denbigh. He was buried yesterday at Torquay. ASTRONOMY.\u2014ON Friday evening, at the Town Hall, the first of the series of lectures on Astronomy, to be given by Professor Gray of I Bangor Cellege: during the winter months, took place. there being a large audience, this lecture being free- Dr J Lloyd Roberts presided and suitably introduced the lecturer. He also re- e ~a in the previous courses of lectures held in S ?rtLn shewed that as compared with the the town,the c0)lege lecturers in other townTthose at Denbigh compared most faVour- Rblv a8 regards attendance and general success. Be then touched upon the subject of astronomy, arging that it would be useful to many m^ds as helping them the better to unuerstand tne great ness of the Creator, and would tend to strengthen their faith in Divine things. There was no reason whatever why science should be regarded as antagonistic to religion, but rather properly understood it tended to prove and uphold religious faith and teaching. Professor Gray then pro- ceeded wjth his lecture, giving introductory particulars as to the early systems and beliefs with regard to the heavenly bodies. He gave particulars as to the better know of these and their relative action on each other. His lecture was well illustrated by dissolving views, and this system of illustration will be adopted throughout the course.",

                "full_text": "LORD AND LADY POLTIMORE have arrived at Nice, where they will stay till the beginning of May. A YOUNG American gentleman, named Bacon, has met with his death at Ventnor under somewhat exceptional circumstances. He and his father on Friday of last week had been for a long ride, and, while leisurely descending a hill, the youth's pony stumbled, pitching the rider head foremost to the ground. He was conveyed home insensible, and four doctors were brought into consultation, including Dr. Victor Horsley, specially summoned from London, who performed an operation, but death ensued from fracture of the skull and compression of the brain. TH. enormous increase of the rates and taxes paid by railway companies is attracting attention. One railway, which used to pay JE62,000 in the half-year, has for the last six months paid no less than \u00a3 101,438. The increase is, of course, almost exclusively in the local rates. SIR ROBERT STAWSLL BALL, who has just been appointed Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge, is every inch an Irishman-his dark hair and eyes, his mobile cheeks, full rich voice, and ready talk. He was born in Dublin just 51 years ago, and early in life devoted himself to scientific studies. He was edu- cated at Trinity College, Dublin, and when 25 years of age was appointed Lord Rosse's astronomer at Parsonstown. In this post he very soon distinguished himself, and honours followed. In 1867 he became Professor of Applied Mathemathics and Mechanism at the Royal \"College of Science of Ireland; he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1873, and the degree of LL.D. was conferred upon him by the Dublin University, and the following year he was appointed by that University Professor of Astronomy, with the office of Astronomer Royal for Ireland. He was knighted in 1886. He has written severe ) popular treatises, and many magazine articles on astronomy, and has lectured on a hundred popular platforms, expounding the wonders of the heavens i to the common people of the earth. Every year Sff* R. Ball lectures at Cambridge for two months with- out missing a single night, and as his lecture fee is 20 guineas, the addition to his income is by w, means inconsiderable. It remains to be men whether he will continue this work as a Cambridge professor. The feeling in Cambridge is, on the whole, one of disappointment at his selection. There is a perma- nent objection to a professor not a Cambridge man, and though Sir Robert Ball will be welcomed per- sonally, at the risk of being considered ungracious, it is hardly too much to say that Cambridge men would have prefered one of their own number \u2014Pall Mall Gazette. LADY HENRY SOMERSET, when she was in New York, drew a startling picture of drunkenness in England among women and working men, which conveyed an impression that the evil was greater in England than in America. By such as are acquainted with the slums of London and those of New York, and who also understand the wide difference between a working man and a loafer, her ladyship s remarks were considered incorrect and indiscreet. According to a recent speech, we are told she is sorrowfully amazed at the poverty to be found in New York, and the condition of its slums! Lady Henry Somerset also describes \"homes in America equal in wretched- ness to the dens of East London! If foreign travellers visiting New York and other large cities in the United States would dive beneath the surface by visiting tenement houses, prisons, and asylums before painting their own country red, it would be better for what American politicians are pleased to tt-r the \"pauper labour of Europe.Sheffield Independent.",

B.A., in the Assembly Room, Llan- gollen, on the 8th inst. It dealt with the pro- gress of Optics and Astronomy in the Nineteenth Century. This century, he said, has seen the wave theory of light firmly established, in spite of the great reputation obtained by the rival theory of Isaac Newton. The success of the former theory is a result of Young's discovery of the principle of interference by which two waves may extin- guish each other as often as the crest of one concides with the trough of another. Starting with this idea, Young succeeded in making two streams of light conflict in such a way as to pro- duce darkness, and under circumstances which left no doubt that the cause of darkness was the meeting of crest and trough. The difficulty that light, unlike other wave motions such as sound, travels in very accurate straight lines, was removed by an appeal to the same principle of interference. Fresnel develeped the theory very ably, and from his study of the phenomena of polarization observed when light travels through Iceland Spar, came to very definite conclusions as to the form of the luminous wave. In the case of sound we have a pulsating movement to and fro along the line of' advance of the sound, a movement which can only in a scientific sense be described as a wave. But in light the waves are supposed to be across the direction of advance, like sea waves, except that sea waves move only in the vertical plane, while waves of ordinary light are not confined to any particular plane. The peculiar form of light known as polarized light, however, is characterised by waves moving in one plane only. One of the most important advances made in the century in connection with both Optics and Astronomy is the development of Newton's lustre experiment culmin- ating in the modern spectroscope. It is found that when the light from any substance (say common salt heated in a spirit flame) is filtered through the prism suitably adjusted, it takes up a definite place in the spectrum, and no other sub- stance has the power to emit light which will oacupy the same place in the spectrum. We have thus a delicate test for common salt and other substances in the position which their light occupies in the spectrum. We can assert that the yellow light of a gas lamp is due to other things than common salt, for it sends yellow to other parts of the spectrum. The last enables us to assert that the sun and stars are composed in the main of substances with which we are already acquainted with on earth. The spectra emitted by burning magnesium, were shown by a spirit lamp with salted wick, and by various pyrotechnic combinations, which were thrown on the screen at the close of the lecture.",

In a inaritime place like Milford lectures delivered on Nautical Astronomy. &c., are of incalculable benefit to the seaman, especially the young sailor; and it was with im- pressions of this natu'-e that we visited the lecture-room, hoping to have our darkness enligh.eiied by bearing and being shewn the conncction arid importance existing bet wen x the knowledge of astronomy and the navigation of a ship; but, we must confess, that in this we were disappointed, for beyond a description of the signs of the zodiac, and a few abstruse remarks upon some 01 the planetary bodies, the lecture was wound up by facetious anecdotes. VVe are, how- ever, in hopes, now that Mr. Howells has got over his virgin lecture, to hear him explain in a future lecture the benefits derivable from a knowledge of astronomy in navigating ships, and in what manner thev are connected. We flatter our- selves that Mr. H. is competent to the task. We cannot close our brief remarks without referring to the unenviable position of the Chairman during the evening, and the lorcible manner in which we were struck with his simi- larity of appearance to that of a bashful and crest-fallen schoolboy. We have heard that \"the chair cannot nr,\" such generaUy may be the case, but, in this instance, our chaii, who had evidently forgot his position, was not breathing his own atmosphere, for his looks bespoke unutter- abtethings. W e really felt very serry for his predicament, ,tllll would have rendered him assistance had we been able.

The risible propensities of the assembly could no longer be suppressed, amidst the cheers of which an evolution of thanks came from the chair of an expression of the pleasure it would give him to see the \u2022'speech\" in print. After this oration a graceful reticade movement again placed the \"chair\" upon his throne,\"and thus was terminated this ludhrous scene. On Thursday evening next the Bev.

Those who have the pleasure of knowing Myfyr Morganwg, Pontypridd, who ia the present Gwyddcn, the generic name of the chief priest of ancient Bardism, from a period eo remote that in comparison with it the arrival of Julius Csmar in Britain is but a modern incident, admit that he IS the most interesting character now dwallia.? within the circuit of the four seas. He is, alas! very old; 80 winters have now passed over hia venerable head, leaving hia hair and flowing beard aa white as wool. Even in boyhood he was regarded as remarkable. Aged people tell me that when he was a youth at home, watching his father's flocks on the slopes of Mynydd y Gaer, above Pencoed, his remarkable characteristics were discussed in the then thinly populated hamlets of Glamorganshire, and it appears that his earliest studies were mathematics and astronomy. It will be hardly credited, but it is nevertheless perfectly trua, that, dwelling in a farm he use in a remote Welah district, where English was but rarely heard, he mastered the I4 nglish grammar without the aid of a tutor. And this acquired knowledge served as a key to enable him to unlook the treasures of English literature. lie then mastered Euclid, passing over Pons Asinorum without any pedagogic assistance, revelling in Bolitude among the problems of the Greek SAGE, for he stateB that this study was a source of infinite enjoyment to him. The movements of the planets early attracted his notice, ard a penny almanack, which his father bad bought at Bridgond, afforded him delight as supplying a key to understand the movements of the heavenly shining orbs. When only 18 years of age he had suiffciently mastered astronomy as to be able to COMVJOSE an almanack from his own calculations, and this almanack is still in existence in manuscript.

Young Lord Blandford, in behalf of whom the application was made on Tuesday to compel the Duke of Marlborough to contribute towards his support, is at present being educated at Cambridge. He will be 21 on November 13 of this year. He is a pale, weak-looking young man'of quiet habits and some promise. MR. DE COBAIN. Mr. De Cobain is (eays the Star) remarkable in appearance; he is medium-sized, stout even to corpulence, brown, sandy hair scrupulously divided at the middle of his head, brown eyes, slight whiskers, and sallow complexion. He always wore in the House a double-breasted frock coat, which was invariably closely buttoned, and he never, either winter or summer, was without a white carnation in his breast, which was quite as conspicuous as Mr. Chamberlain's now forsaken orchid. LITERARY TEAS.\" While English ladies of birth and breeding are acquainting themselves with the refinements of music-hall entertainments, aristocratic German ladies are indulging in literary teas,\" for which there is quite a rage just now. It is to be hoped, however, that this intellectual form of dissipation will not become too madly popular over here, as the prospect of having to discuss muffins and Ibsen at the same time is appalling. Our German sisters have at least the most delicious confectionery in the world (home-made, by-the-bye) with which to cheer themselves up. DOCTORS AND LITERARY MEN. Mr. James Payn, in his letter to the New York Independent, complains jthat the bull's eye of the surgeon is now being turned on the literary man. \"The American physicians have begun it. 'The literary worker,' they eay, 'should take a light breakfast, nothing at noon, and the evening meal when his work is done.' Worse advice to any one who knows the real demands of literary work it is impossible to conceive; but the futility of any advice at all on such a subject is obvious. There is nothing in which men's minds vary so much as in the conditions they find favourable for literary composition. Some write like Thackeray, by fits and starts, some like Trollope, with the regularity of clockwork. some by day, some by night, some fasting, some exhilarated by gin-and-water (like Byron), some stimulated by tobacco (like Tennyson); there is no sort of rule for general guidance.\" SIR ROBERT BALL.

Each of these ideas is absolutely erroneous. Astronomy is divided into two great, sections, the first of which is concerned with the nature of the stars, the second with their whereabouts. This last department is, indeed, abstruse, but wi th- out it navigation would be almost impossible, and the world would be. robbed of its present means of obtaining absolutely correct time. But we have no need to concern ourselves with this department, when the first is displayed j invitingly before us. Ilere is no need of mathematics. All that is required is a good, eye and an opera-glass or telescope, and the desire to learn something of the wonders and beauties of the universe. To the study of this department observational astronomy the I reader is invited, and he or she will find it, if persevered in, one of the most fascinating of pursuits. As for the hopelessness of learning j the stars, let us examine it a little more closely. IJDok up at the sky at nine o'clock one of these early June evenings, and you will find that but very few of the stars are of any con- \u25a0spicuous order of brightness. Indeed at this rvaiir three of the most brilliant axe above the horizon\u2014Capelia, Vega, and Arc- turns. By reference to our little map (a, very rough one, be it noted), the reader will iind A returns, a fine orange star, high up m the southern heavens, whilst the electric gleam of Vega- is instant!v descried in the east, and Capelia low down in the north-west. Other stars, cxmspw-iuous enough, but les.c bright, than this grand trio, will be noted, such as Castor and Pollux, Spica, Kegulus, and the seven stars of the .Hear the latter are most useful as guides\u2014the Bear's tail always guiding the eye to Arcturus, whilst lines through the square uf stars, forming the. body of the plough or the hind quarters of the bear, point in one direction to the pole- star; in another to Vega, in another to Capella, in another to the Lion, and so 0]1. Thus, step by step, we advance to a knowledge of the stars and constellations, a knowledge which may be further developed by that most delight- ful of books, Dunkin's \"Midnight Sky\" (a new edition of which was published lately by the -Religious Traot Society), and the more advanced atlases of Proctor and Ball. The bright star, Spica, which is to be seen in the south in our map, is an excellent guide to Saturn, which shines to north of it with equal brilliancy: the ring system of Saturn renders it, as everyone knows, one of the most striking and conspicuous objects in the heavens. Of the other planets, Mercury and Uranus are evening s,tars, Venus a morning star, and Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune in- visible. The moon i \u00a3 new on tins /-vd, full on tba IrHlx.",

Mr. Maunder, of th Royal Observatory, Greenwich, continues his helpful series of popular articles on \"Astronomy without a Telescope,\" in the April issue of Know- ledge.\" Dealing with the Northern Stars, Mr. Maunder says: \"To us in England, with our high northern latitude, the stars which never set are the first the study of which we should undertake. They are, al- ways present, they cover more than one- third of the entire sky visible to us at anv moment. They include many conspicuous ttars, and form an admirable guide to the constellations beyond the circumpolar re- gion. Constantly revolving round the pole they fcrm, as it were, a magnificent dial plate, marking at the same time the progress both of the night and of the year. ATHE chief guiding stars for the northern heavens aro the well-known Plough, the scarcely less distinctive little W of Cassicpeia on the op- posite side of the Pole, and the two great brilliants between them on the right hand and on the left, Capella and Vega. All these are continually visible for Scotland and the North of England; for the southern part of our island Vega is lost for a short time when due north.\" The writer does not dis- dain the poet's aid, by whom Polaris is figured thus:- \"Where yonder radiant hosts adorn The northern evening sky, Seven stars a splendid glorious train First fix the wandering eye. To deck great Ursa'3 shaggy form Those brilliant orbs combine And where the first and second part There see Polaris shine. Between the two bears it is easy to trace out the irregular winding line of fairly bright stars. This is the Dragon the Serpent of the following lines from Aratus \u2014 et Between these two, liko to a river s branch, A mightv prodigy, the Serpent twines Its bending vast around; on either side His coil they move and shun the dark blue eea \u2022 But o'er the cne his lengthy tail is stretched, The other's wrapped in coIl..",

The following quaint specimen of his writings, extracted from one of his medical works, may not be unacceptable to the reader,-like the bards of his native country, he conveved his multifarious information to the public through the medium of verse:- \"A fox in craftiness exceedeth most men, A dog in smelling hath no man his peer; To foresight of weather, if you look then, Many beasts excel man-this is clear. The wittiness of elephants doth letters attain, And what cunning doth there in the bee remain! The nightingale, the linnet, the thrush, the lark In musical harmony pass many a clerk. The hedgehog of astronomy seemeth to know, And stoppeth his cave when the wind doth blow; The spider in weaving such art doth show, No man can him mend or follow I trow; When a house will fall the mice right quick Flee thence before man can do the like.\"",

He lodged with Thomas Yaughan, at Lwydcoed, with whom he quarrelled on the previous evening, and left the house, being at the time in a state of intoxication. On the following morning ha was found in a field not far distant, dangerously ill. He was immediately taken home, and expired a few hours, afterwards. ACCIDENTS.\u2014On the evening of Monday last, John Evans met with an accident while at his- work, at Bwllfa- dare colliery, by which his thigh and arm were both broken. The poor fellow was conveyed home without delay, in the most intense agony but under the care of his medical attendant he is progressing as favourably as the circumstances of the case will admit. On the following day, Evan Thomas, a miner, living at Llwydcoed, broke hi3 thigh by a fall of coal, but we are glad to add that he is in a fair way for recovery. LECTURE AT SALEM CHAPEL.\u2014A lecture was recently delivered in the above chapel, by the R. Wm. Rees, of Liverpool, in Welsh, on the Inquiries of the human mind into the works of God.\" The rev. lecturer, after a few and appropriate remarks on the works of God in general, confined himself to the investigation of the human mind in one particular direction, viz., astronomy. Having made some interesting observations, showing the importance of this exhaustless subject, he went on to prove from the examples of Job, David, Amos, &c., that the study of the heavens was not only prompted by reason, but also authorised by Scripture. He then pro- ceeded to trace the history of astronomy, which he di- vided into three periods. The first period was the anti- historical, in which man discovered the causes of the eclipses of the sun and moon\u2014the spherical form of the earth &c The second period embraced the fruitless endeavours of the sages of Greece and the scholars of Alexandria, to explain the revolutions of the orbs of Heaven, on the supposition that the earth was the centre planet. The third was the modern period, which con- tains the researches of Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and Newton. It is, however, impossible to give an adequate idea of the lecture in a short summary. The rev. lec- 1 turer evinced a thorough knowledge of the subject, lie was happy in his illustrations and not only made him- I self understood by a mixed audience, but even succeedea I in making his lecture popular, and in the highest degree I interesting. The lecture gave general satisfaction and we were happy to see the spacious chapel well filled.",

Mercury is a morning star this month, and Venus is gaining in brilliancy and is conspicuous in the western sky towards the end of the month up to nearly II p.m. Mars is still visible, and Jupiter is with us from sunset until early dawn. Saturn is in conjunction with the Sun on the 20tb, and afterwards becomes a morning star. His rings are still closed. Of the stars, Arcturus has made his appearance in the E. The handle of the plough points to him. Capella is in N.W., and Vega, which is circum- polar and never really sets, although lost to sight through the haze of the horizon, may be seen late rising in the East. The Southern aspect is one of unsurpassing beauty. There are no fewer than nine stars of the first and second magnitude all visible, Capella, Castor, Pollux, Procyon in the little dog, Regulus in Leo, or the Sickle, the majestic Sirius under Orion which contains Betelgeux and Rigel and further away the ruddy Aldebaran which is the eye of the Bull. Has it ever occurred to any of us what insignifi- cant atoms we all are compared with the vast magnitude of the distances between our own planet and the distant Suns ? So immense are these distances that in our own actual mileage the figures are quite bewildering, and convey no adequate idea of what the true position really is. It is customary to employ, in astronomy, as a fixed unit for stellar distances, the distance traversed by light in one year. Now it is well known this travels 185,000 miles per second, consequently a ray of light from the nearest known star-Alpha Centaurai-takes 4t years to span the heavenly abyss and this run out gives the stupendous total of 24,750,000,000,000 miles Sirius; perhaps the best known star in the htaveni-\u2014\u00ab ecause it 's the brightest-is double that distance, and the light we see nightly from him left him over 9 years ago Ca.n we grasp or comprehend what these wonders mean ? I Astronomy owes much to Bradley for his memorable discovery of the Aberration of Light.\" This resulted in many unknown wonders being revealed to us. And now the grand discovery has beeu made by Kapteyn that a great part of space, so fur as we have any visible knowledge of i., id occupied by two majestic streams of stars travelling in opposite directions, and the amazing truth has been deciphered that the stars of both streams are alike in design, chemical constitution, and in process of development.\" Truly may we be permitted to ask-\" When will wonders cease ?\"",

This formed the subject of Mr Proctor's second lecture at the Tredegarville Chapel, and which was delivered on Thursday evening to a very large audience, although the weather was most unfavourable. The lime-light apparatus had been got into working order, and the views were excel- lent. The lecture embraced some of the salient points of that given on Wednesday evening. This became necessary to explain the views of the sun which could not be seen on the pre- ceding evening, but which were as per- fect as they well could be on Thursday. Mr Proctor gave a glance on (the solar system, its division into families, and then passed on to notice the giant planets. His views on the planets Saturn and Jupiter were no doubt novel to many, and calculated to induce his audience to read for themselves, and make the science of astronomy a study. This seems one of the great advantages of these lectures. Much was explained last evening that could only have been arrived at by long study. At the same time, there was something so interesting in the description he gave, so much that was really wonderful in the character and constitution of the whole solar system, that those who listened could not fail to have their minds awakened, and their thoughts turned to the investigation of a subject which has always been regarded as beyond the comprehen- sion of those who are not gifted with considtr- able mathematical knowledge. Mr Proctor's re- marks v,va]d seUus audience thinking for them- selves, and when he had done that he had achieved a great task, for there is no science so full of interest, once its study is commenced, as that of astronomy. For whatever purpose Mr Proctor has been brought to Cardiff, the office bearers of the chapel have served a good one in bringing before so many persons the most recent and the most carefully studied views on the harmony displayed in the worlds around us, and how wonderfully each works sub- servient to one great whole. They were also cal- culated to remove many absurd notions held re- specting the sun, the earth, and the planets of the uuiverse.",

                "full_text": "ASTRONOMY AND METEOROLOGY. At first sight it lappears very strange that while astronomy and meteorology, probably the two oldest sciences, have occupied the attention of mankind from the earliest ages, the former, dealing entirely with other worlds than our own, has long ago attained the dignity of an exact science, while the latter, the Itady of the atmosphere in which we live, is still in the embryo state. Centuries before Aristotle wrote L-in treatise on meteorology the anoients had drawn up empirical rules, based on the appearance of the sky, the flight of birds, the behaviour of animals, and so forth, intended to guide them to a foreknowledge of weather changes. The sole claim to popularity of I truay modern annual publications is to be found in the persistency with which their authors pretend to be able to predict the weather of every day for a whole year. But this is not by any means a modern idea, as identically the same thing was done in Egypt 30 centuries ago, and it is very likely that the ancients were even more successful than their modern imitators. Of quite a different origin are the weather forecasts which now ap- pear daily in the Press. Those valued friends of the almanaok maker, the moon and the stars, have within the past 30 or 40 years been dethroned, and an entirely new method of studying atmospheric fluctuations has been adopted. Whether the official forecasts so familiar to everybody are any better than those favoured by past generations is a question about which there are many opinions, but this in itself is but a small matter in reality, for meteoro- logists tell us that the public demands forecasts, while science is still at a loss to explain the causes of the changes which affect us. The work commenced by Redfield 60 years ago is still in the experimental stage, but sufficient bas been accomplished to revolu- tionise our ideas of the subject; and, while we cannot oontrol the vast forces which are generated in astorm, it is found possible to lessen the danger by improved construction of buildings and by the proper manoeuvring of ships. The advance which has been made in our knowledge of the circulation of the wind in storms has enabled seamen to so skilfully manage their vessels that all the money ever spent on meteorological research has been more than repaid by the saving of life and property in one yea.",

Hansby, Esq., surgeon, Abergavenny, assisted by W. Hill, Esq., surgeon, performed this operation on a man of the name of John Havard, a labourer, residing at Clytha Hill, who has been suffering for a length of time from a diseased, knee-joint, and every means used to prevent amputation being necessary, but without effect. The operation was periormed in the presence of F. C. Batt and G. Foote, Esqrs., surgeons,' of Abergavenny. Havard states he never experienced the slightest pain in the removal of the limb, and is, we are glad to hear, doing well. THE IHON TRADE.\u2014The state of trade on the hills still con- tinues to be in a very depressed state, and there appears not the slightest probability, at present, of an advance in the price of iron. This certainly looks very bad, and must be very dis- couraging to the employer as well as the men. We hope that now the weather has become more settled, we shall experience a revival in trade. WE are happy to state that the weather has taken a decided change. During the last week it has been extremely fine and beautiful. We had our doubts, that in consequence of the se- verity of the weather, much injury would have been done to the wheat and early fruit; but we learn, from good authority, that the grain in this neighbourhood looks well, and has been but slightly injured. ABERGAVENNY READING AssoCIATION.-On Friday, the 27th ultimo, the first of a series of lectures of the present season, on behalf of the above institution, was delivered in the Free Gram- mar School, by E. Y. Steele, Esq. The talented lecturer's sub- ject was Light, its important Laws and Properties.\" The lecture was illustrated by diagrams, which must have given the lecturer a vast deal of trouble in getting them up. The lec- turer exhibited great talent, and a thorough acquaintance with his subject, which was listened to with the deepest attention and interest. At the close of the address he was loudly ap- plauded, and thanks were voted unanimously to him. ON Monday, the 1st instant, Mr. Po ph-im, whose celebrity is spread far and wide as a lecturer on astronomy, again paid us a visit, after an absence of ten years, and delivered a most inter- esting and instructive lecture on astronomy, in the Cymreig- yddion Hall. We are glad that the good folks of Abergavenny have not forgotten Mr, Popham's former visit, and that he was so well supported on this occasion.",

Mr. Caradoc Mills entertained an appreciative audience, on Thursday evening, at Horeb Chapel, Llanrwst, with a truly delightful illustrated lecture entitled Other worlds than ours; or, the wonders of astronomy.\" This was Mr Mills' first public appearance in the capacity of lecturer, and his grasp of the difficult subject and his finished style produced a most favourable impression on the audience, who followed his every word with the closest interest, Mr Mills ts to be congratulated upon his well-deserved success. He spoke in Welsh for an hour and a quarter without the aid of notes. His language was simple yet graphic, his delivery distinct and pleasing, and the dis- course was illumined bv occasional flashes of humour which lent it an added interest. The success of the lecture was heightened by the able manner in which the oxy-hydro lantern was manipulated by the rising young scientist's father. The proceeds of the lecture are to be presented to Mr J. R. Jones, the conductor of the Juvenile Prize Choir, and a member of Horeb Chapel, who is leaving the town next week. THE CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS. The chair was occupied bo Mr. D. J. Williams, of the Council Schools, who in a short speech said he was pleased to see so many present to show their good feelings and wishes to Mr J. R. Jones, who is leaving to take up a better position in England. He (Mr Williams) was very sorry to loose him from his school, as lie had been with him for many years, and was a good teacher. He hoped the change would be beneficial to him in every respect. (Applause). He would also remind them that Mr Caradoc Mills, the lecturer, was an old scholar from his school, and that gave him a double interest in the meeting that evening. The meeting opened with the singing of the old hymn, \"Newyddion Braf,\" &c., and during two short intervals in the lecture Miss Williams (Bradford House) rendered the song Ora pro nobis with good effect, whilst Miss Jones (of \"The Bull\") rendered a solo, Nearet-, my God, to Thee,\" very sweetly, Mr R. R. Owen accompanying on the organ. The usual votes of thanks having been accord- ed, the meeting terminated with the singing of the appropriate hymn, \"Duw mawr y rhyfeddodau maith.",

ZadkicVs Almanacks will now be found on the counters of nearly every bookseller in London, and they would not be there unless there were people to buy them-not poor and uneducated people merely, for they are found in shops into which these but seldom enter, the shops of the rich and well-to-do. In this almanack it is declared in the most strenuous manner that the received, or Copernician, system of astronomy is a fable. In sober truth,\" we are told, none but a man educated to the idea, could for a moment imagine that this enormous globe of earth, which is.25,0Q0 miles in circumference, is forever hurry- ing away through space at the mean rate of 68,000 miles in an hour, which is over 1,133 miles in a minute. If we had not been educated to believe in this absur- dity, we should scout the first man who asserted it to us as a madman. The more we examine the question, the more we see its ridiculous nature, and perceive that the truth is found only in agreement with the solemn assertion of God's word.\" The truth is that the earth is stationary, that it is the centre of the solar system, that it is only 365,006 miles from the sun, that the moon is but 32,828 miles distant, that the sun is not nearly so huge a body as the men of science vainly imagine, that it is only 3,407 miles in diameter, and that the diameter of the moon is not more than 301 miles. The Scriptures are invoked in the most solemn manner to prove the falsehood of the modern astronomy; there are elaborate unintelligible calculations to show the unsoundness of the Newton- ian philosophy; and to make assurance doubly sure we are shown from astrology that Newton was bound to go wrong and to mislead the world in the fatuity of his reason. When such nonsense as this finds a sale in the shops of London to which people of education resort, perhaps the less we say the better of the stu- pidity of those who resisted and persecuted \"the starry Galileo.\"",

                "full_text": "DEATH OF SIR GEORGE AIRY Six months after the completion of his 90th year, Sir George Biddell Airy, the seventh Astronomer Royal, has passed away. He died at Greenwich, at half-past six on Saturday evening, after a few mouths' illness. He had a fall in the summer, and received an injury which involved a surgical operation. This seemed to be successful at the time, but he has been gradually sinking ever since. Sir George Airy's name is one that has never come prominently before the general public, though for 65 yearii it has been a familiar and honoured name in the great world of science. So far as we know, the only work by him which has a professedly popular stamp is a little book en- titled Popular Astronomy,\" which has passed through numerous editions, but which is really intended\" to explain to intelligent persons the principles on which the instruments of an obser- vatory are constructed.\" Tho fact is, the late Astronomer-Royal's mind was rigidly scientific, wo might almost say rigidly mathematical. Any scientific problem or scientific theory, or indeed, any application of science which could not be made to squara with his lSevemly mathe- matical tests, ho was api to regard with distrust. It may be remembered that in the early stages of construction of the Forth Bridge he wrote at considerable length to prove that no bridge built upon the principles which were being applied could possibly stand. But in the peculiar position which Sir George Airy had to fulfil as Astronomer Royal, these little failings probably leaned to virtue's side. The great business of his iife was to deal practically with mathematical astronomy, to reconstruct a great observatory, and to carry out its chief object\u2014astronomical observations on mathematical lines. This, his great life-work, he accomplished with a masterly completeness that left nothing to bo desired. Sir Georgo Airy was born at Alnwick, North- umberland, on July 27, 1801 he was educated at private schools at Hereford and Colchester, and at Manchester Grammar School, from which he passed in 1819 to Trinity College. Cambridge, as sizar. Ho was elected scholar in 1822, graduated as Senior Wrangler m 1823, and was elected a Fellow of his college in 1821. --1,-1'81",

The art critic of the Westminster Gazette says:\u2014 There are few thmgs more difficult in the art world than to establish the genuineness of any newly-discovered masterpiece, especially if the find occur in any part of Italy or in the provinces of England. This is as it should be, for the enthusiasm of the picture-hunter generally carries him away, and in spite of all his lniLa-fides he is usually a very untrustworthy and wholly unsatisfactory picture-finding witness. His predisposition in favour of miracles and picture-dealing marvels is unlimited, and any scepticism on the part of others is Bet down, not to prudence born of experience, but to envy not unmixed with ignorance. The latest discovefY- which may, of course, be genuine\u2014is the sudden appearance at Swansea (of all places in the world) of a Raphael, representing the reconciliation of astronomy, philosophy, and theology, which is valued at no less a sum than \u00a312,000. The dis- covery of the picture, or of its value, has been attended by that of its history and pedigree. It was painted \"for one of the Popes;\" it was in Spain \"for a long period,\" and was 200 years in the family of the lady who was astute enough to buy it, but not astute enough to discover it till the other day, when someone else did it for her. The story is vague enough. But has it not occurred to anybody that Raphael executed a commission tor Pope Julius II., a ceiling for the Camera della Segnatura, in the Vatican, in which astronomy, philosophy, and theology also appeared, but not so much in '\u25a0 reconciliation as in medallions ? Before any-, body pays down \u00a3 12,000 for the new chef d'eeuvre, he would do well to compare it with the works I have named (which have been duly engraved by Audran and by Morghen), and apply a few of the tests that may be suggested to him by the shrewder and more scholarly of\" the picture dealers and experts.",

Tins fwi-med th subject of Mr Proctor's second lecture at the Tredegarville Chapel, and which was delivered on Thursday evening' to a vary large audience, although the weather was most unfavourable. The lime-light apparatus had been got into working order, and the views were excel- lent. The lecture c-niie-aoed some of the salient points of that given on Wednesday evening. This became necessary to explain the views of the sun which could not be seen on the rre- ceding evening, but which were a? per- fect as thAy wed could be on Thursday. Mr Proctor gave a glance on .tne solar system, its division into families, an I then passed\" 011 to notice the giant panels. His views on the planets Saturn and J npiter were no doubt novel to iii and calculated to induce his audience to reed for themselves, and make the science of astronomy a rtndy. This seems or.e of the great ad vantages of thc.e lectures. Much was explained last evening th?t could i-l,v bee a arrived at by long study. At tiie s-une time, there something so interesting in the description lie gaye, so much that was really wonderful in U. character and constitution of the whole Kilar system, that thos-e who listened could not f;wl to have their minds awakened, and their thoughts turned to the investigation of a. subject, which has always been regarded as beyond the c(1rnprchcn- sion of those who are not gifted with consider- able mathematical knowk-Jge. Mr Provtor's re- marks would set his audience thinking for tlism- selves, and when he had done that lie had achieved a great tssk, for there is 110 science so full of interesr, once its study is coniva'1ne_d, as that of astronomy. For whatever pnrp/js Mr Procter hos been brought to Cardiff, the office hearers o; the chnp-'l have served a good one in bringing bef-re so maiij* persons the most recent and the most carefully studied views on the harmony displayed in the worlds around us, and how ) each works- sub- servient to on3 g-reat whole.

I NOMY. \"Observational Astronomv\" is the title of a book which will prove interesting, not only to the amateur telescopisi, but to readers generally. It is just the book lor a beginner, containing, as it does, a quantity of matter seldom, if ever, found in ordi- n\" ry astronomical works. It is an attempt to pro- vide an inexpensive treatise which, while formin\" a stepping-stone to a fracticalacqunirtancewith the scenery of the heavens, gives, in simple torms, the results achieved by the latest research in thosa d\". partments most affected by the amateur. To this end Mr. Mee, an eminently sale guide we may say, has treated the subject unconventionally, and mathematics are eschewed, the author occupying himself chiefly with describing the aspect and physical condition of the t-i bs about us. Conciseness and accuracy hav\u00ab* been the 111111 throughout, and the numerous refe- rences to other sources of information cannot but increase tlie usefulness of a little volume wh.es when read in connection with it good elemeniarr bxt-book, will Iny open the way for thf s' udent to become familiar with a ni(ii-o purely scientific treatment of astronomy HS a whoW. The author's style has considerable c ii.rm, and his presentation of his subject shows a cie-ir coucepti.m of what is likely to be iipprecinted, while, for the book itoelf, much has teen done ill the way of appearance, some of the numerous Illustrations being remarkably good. It may aho be mentioned that the work includes u memoir of the lato Prebendary Webb, who did so much for observational aBtronomy. The notice is the fullest and best extant, and will have especial interest for Welsh readers generally, because Mr. Webb lived and died at Hay, and to Cardiff readers in particular, ubcause his father was once Vicar of St. John's. In the preparation of his useful little work, Mr. Mee has had the advantage of being nutated by some of the best authorities living and fact of no small impor- tance is that the book has been well printed, and the illustrations are unusually numerous and \u2022^cellent. \"Observational Astronomy: A Book for Beginners.\" By Arthur Mee, F.R A..?;;iilh M' 2..

It is just the book for a beginner, containing, as it does, a quantity of matter seldom, if ever, found in ordi- nary astronomical works. It is an attempt to pro- vide an inexpensive treatise which, while forming a stepping-stone to a pr.icticalacquaintincewithtlie scenery of the heavens; gives, in simple terms, the results achieved by the Ititest research in those de- partments most, affected by the amateur. To this end Mr. Mee, an eminently safe guide we may sav, has treated the subject unconventionally, and mathematics ,re eschewed the author occupying himself chiefly wil II describing the aspect and physical condition of the orbs about us. Conciseness and accuracv have been the aim throughout, and the numerous refe- rences to other sources of information cannot but, increase the usefulness of a little volume which when read in connection with a good elementary text-book, will lay open the way for the Student to become familiar with a more purely scientific treatment of astronomy as a whole. The author's style has considerable chnrm, and his presentation of his subject shows a clear conception of what is likely to be appreciated while, for the book itself, much has been done ill the way of appearance, some of the numerous illustrations being remarkably good. It may nl-o be mentioned that the work includes a memoir of the lato Prebendary Webb, who did so much for observational astronomy, The notice is tho fullest and best extant, and will have especial interest for Welsii readers generally, because Mr. Webb lived and died at Say, and to Cardiff readers in particular, because his father was once Vicar of St. John's. In the preparation of his useful little work, Mr. Mee has had the advantage of being assisted by some of the best, authorities living and a fact of no smalt impm- tance is triat the book lias been well printed, and the illustrations are unusually numerous and I excellent.. \"Observational .A gronomy: \u00c5 Book for Be\u00ablDnerfl.

Sir, \u2014 I was muc-h pleased to sec \"Inquirer's\" letter in your columns of Tuesday, because it voices a sentiment which is none the less general for being hi.thpl\"to unexpressed. Thou- sands take a deep and increasing interest in astronomy, and are always ready to pay atten- tion when the wonders of the universe n.re portrayed in anything approach:ng an attrac- t've form. Yet. though lectures are delivered and ulidcs shown, and though hooks on astronomy are well nigh as numerous as the fiti.rs, the public telescope is conspicuous by its absence. People may iisten and read, but they must not look a.t the wonders for them- selves Cardiff is an example of most Eng- lish towns in this particular, but they manage tilings better elsewhere. Take, for instance, Germany. At Berlin there is a fine. public olbservatory (the Vrania S\u00bbternwarte), wirh excellent instruments, to which the public have aocsss on paymeni., of a quite insignificant fee. This institution is well patronised, but t'he poor Cardifnan must needs peep through a small street telescope or go without. Tno.-c of us who possess instruments are constat*1 ly pestered with appl'col ions for a. nearer view of the heavenly bodfes. and there is little doubt that if a good telescope were provided in i proper hands it would not want, for patronage. Fine instruments are. to be obtained very cheaply nowadays, and \u00a3 100 would provide Cardiff with a reflector of large dimensions and first quality performance, whilst another \u00a3 50 would pro- \u00a1 bably cover the cost of a suitable \"house.\" I commend this matter to our educational authorities and to Cardittians at large, and 1 see no reason why that which is done on a big \",<,ale at Berlin should not be done, ait leact in a small way. at the Metropolis of Wales.

Fisher Uuwiu, 26, Paternoster Row, 1887.\u2014Price 6s.\u2014 This handsomely issued novel is an artintic study of aristocratic and plebeian life in the Principality of Wales, and the story, which is unflagging in human and scenic interest, is ably told us in a prologue and thirty chapters. Tho' the plot is laid in wild Wales, the authoress does not weary us with Welsh scenery, but whisks us off with her characters on their jouruejs to Rome, Paris, Marseilles, Genoa, &c., and we visit not only the Tycoch Colliery, wheie a catastrophic explosion takes place, but also go to a Ball in distinguished company, take a voyage in the \"Europa,\"&e. The book does not easily lend itself to exerptiug, and it would be unfair to give a synopsis of the plot, so we must refer our readers to the volume 0 itself, which reflects high credit both upon authoress and publisher. The tale is one of the most vivid and realistic ever published with Wales as its scene de theatre, and, since there is a generally awakening interest in Wales and all things Welsh we predict for it a must encouraging popularity. CUIRU FYDD.\"\u2014North Wales Liberal Federation. The Land Question and Lund Bill. With special reference to Wales. By B. A. Jones, 13.A., Barrister-at- Law. Price Is. Hughes and Sun, Hope street, Wrex- bam.\u2014This is an excellent shilling's worth of well- thought out and well-expressed matter relating t:> the agncultuial position of Wales, past, present, and future, and we commend it to all who wish to inform themselves on a. subject of such general and pressing interest. The contents of Mr Jones's useful and suggestive book we refer to at some length in our leading aiticle of this week. KNOWLEDGE, AN ILLUSTRATED MAGAZINE OF SCIENCE. LITERATURE AND ART.-This magazine, which is edited by the well-known and learned Mr H. A. Proctor, stands in the very forefront of our serial liteiature for real breadrli and depth of original information on the sublets treated upon, and for variety and interest of the contents. We heartily commend it to the attention of all readers who can appreciate tho difference between mere verbal compilation and common-place, sensational story-telling, and new thought, tersely expressed, touching the greatest problems of existence. THE SEAL OF THE SNAKE.\u2014A secret in seven coils. By R E. Francillon. Being Gr.mt and Uo.'f Christmas annual for 1887.\u2014Mr Francillon is always artistic and picturesque as well as deeply interesting, and in the work before us he has more than maintained his previously won reputation. The story is divided into s'vcn chapters or coils and each one introduces us to strange characters, in strange scenes, but all are described with .a felicity of touch which cannot fail to charm the reader, who is carried on Irom beginning to end of the story with ever- increasing euthralln.er.t under the plot. We run very little risk when we say that this is the best Christmas story of the current year, and we commend it to all who care for a. seasonable story, well concerned and well told. CASSELL'S ILLUSTRATED ALMANACK FOR 1888.-This popular publication has just been issued, and fully comts up to the high standard of pist years. It is profusely and excellently illustrated with splendid woodcuts. It also contains, besides the useful calendar (which, by the way, is very ingeniously inserted in illustrations, descriptive of the seasons), many pages of valuable general information, viz the names of the Koyal Family, the members of both Houses of Parliament with their political leanings, memoirs of some of the leading lights who have joined the majority during the past year, together with the most salient facts concerning a few of the leading men of the day, postal and telegraphic information, &c. It also contitius a complete list of the fairs which are to be held during the year in Great Britain. This will make the almanack a valuable hand-book to cattle dealers, manufacturers, &c. The eclipses, movable feas-ts, law terms &c., are all noticed and dated, so that altogether this year's almanack will be welcomed in many households as a reliable, useful and entertaining acquisition, the price (6d.) bringing it within the reach of all classes. OUR DARLINGS. \u2014 John F. Shaw and Co., 48, Paternoster Row. London, KC.-The completed volume of chis excellent treasury for children (edited by Dr Barnardo), has arrived, and without doubt is a most gratifying addition to the literature which is now published for the benefit of children. We have often drawn attention in these columns to the good work of love in which Dr Barnardo has been for many years engaged among poor street boys and girls how he rescues them from sin and shame, trains them in his commodious and comfortable homes at 18 to 2G, Stepney Causeway, London, E., and then when they are fitted for the struggle of life by having learnt various trades and occupations, are drafted off to Canada and elsewhere to take their part as industrious and honourable members of society in our colonies. Our Darlings is another means by which Dr Barnardo succeeds in doing good by pro- viding healthy, wholesome literature for our little ones. The magazine under notice is a large, well illustrated one, contains countless stories on all sorts of subjects, and is bound to give satisfaction to those who are fortunate enough to secure copies. It is not only sure to entertain our little mites who delight to gaze at the pictures, but will also entertain our juveniles of riper .-ge by the abundance and excellence of its literature. This year's volume commences a new series and contains hundreds of well-executed full-page illustrations, coloured and plain, together with countless smaller ones, well calculated to interest readers of all ages. It also contains a charmingly succinct history of \"Britain's Queen,\" (by Pearl Fisher), from the birth of her Majesty at Kensington Palace, to the memorable ceremony at Westminster Abbey on the 21st June last; a serial story \"Dickie's Secret,\" (by Catherine Shaw); Joss,\" a tale by Mrs Stanley Leathes while it fairly teams with short stories on almost every conceivable subject connected with birds, beasts, and reptiles, domestic pets, and pets that are not domestic, the stories and tales being written in a style that is sure to bring pleasure to all. We should like to enumerate many of the excellent merits of the handsome volume, but the space at our disposal forbids it. A coloured frontispiece, \"An Unwelcome Guest,\" is most amusing. A little baby boy, whilst enjoying his plate of porridge on the grass, accompanied by little bunny, is disagreeably surprised by a great ugly green frog, who, unobserved, approaches, and suddenly leaps upon the plate, anxious, no doubt, to participate ia the feast. The expression which overshadows the child's features directly he sees the state of things, must be seen to be appreciated.\" It is one which many mothers (and father; too) would say is true to the life and is bound to amuse. Another exquisite coloured plate shows two little boys, in the defth of winter, giving their little sisters a sleigh ride over the snow. A third pourtrays a little one, with her feeding bottle, keeping company with the chicks. A fourth discovers a bright-faced lad, accompanied by his dog, on his return home from the woods, well laden with liolly for the Christmas decorations. The other coloured plates give an excellent portrait of Her Majesty the Queen; My Bunny,\" (a little girl nursing her pet rabbit); He won't bite,\" (an uninviting mastiff held by his little mistress); \"Let me do some,\" (the little bouncing baby hOlY, whe is anxious to help mother on washing day); We are both getting old,\" (the old clock-maker taking grandfather's clock abroad and soliloquising); \"Velvet and Fur,\" (a beautiful little child dressed in velvet nursing her little pussy cat); \"Mother's darling,\" (depicting a nursing mother and her babe). The lettrr press, also, is on a par with the illustrations for clearness and excellence, and altogether the latest vol ume of Our Darlings\" is a most welcome publication, and will make one of the most highly-prized presents which can be made at this season of the year. We commend it to parents who have the interest of their little ones at heart. It is also well bound in an illustrated cover, and does great credit to the publishing house of Messrs F. Shaw and Company, as well as to the editor. A NEW WORK ON ASTRONOMY is about to be issued by Richard A. Proctor, the author of the articles on Astronomy in The Encyclopedia Britannica' and in The American Cyclopaedia,' which will deserve atten- tion. Its chief object will be to present in popular yet scientifically sound form those views of the heavenly bodies which are included in what, in his last poem, Tennyson calls the New Astronomy.' The life histories of worlds and suns will be dealt with the planets will be studied as illustrating the stages of our own earth's life, while the record of our earth will be considered as illustrating the life histories of the planets. The sun will be studied as the one star we can examine, and thus as telling us all we know in detail about the nature of other suns and the stars will be considered as throwing light upon the probable past and future of the ruling and life-giving centre of the solar system. While thus the general characteristics of the new astronomy will he presented, points of detail in which the astronomy of to-day differs from the astronomy of a quarter of a century ago will be fully considered (for the first time) in th\" forthcoming volume. Amoisg these points may be specially mentioned. 1. Changed views as to the structure of our galaxy, from the uniformity formerly imagined to a variety of forms, arrangement, and move- ments akin to what is found in the solar system, but on a much grander se,ile. 2. New views as to the sun's condition and surroundings, opening with Kircboff's interpretation of the solar spectrum, but including many details and discoveries relating to the sun's surface, vaporous envelopes, the sierra, the coloured flames, the corona, and the zodiacal. 3. Changed views, now generally adopted, as to the condition of the various orders of bodies \u2014 giant planets, terrestrial planets, moons, asteroids, &c.\u2014attending on the sun. 4. The recognition of the moon as presenting the history of our earth's past as well as future life-even of stages of vulcanian history whose records in the earth's case have long since been destroyed by denudation. o- Kecent ideas respecting comets and meteois, by which all orders of both classes of bodies are included under one theory of volcanic ejection from swns and planets when in the sunlike stage of their careers. It is proposed, further, to present in this treatise, full explanations of several matters which have been insufficiently or inexactly dealt with in all except one or two books on popular astronomy. Among them are 1. The tides, correctly dealt with in no treatise on popular astronomy except Lord Grimthorpe's 'Astronomy without Mathematics,' the old incorrect explanation being given in most books, and even in Herschel's admirable' Outlines,' while a new and equally incorrect explanation (the centrifugal fallacy) appears in some recent treatises. 2. The precession of the equinoxes, as a case of gyration which is not explained accurately and sufficiently in any treatise on popular astronomy. 3. The discovery of Neptune, correctly but not popularly dealt with by Professor Grant in his admirable History of Physical Astronomy,' and explained fully in Herschel's Outlines,' but nowhere else properly dealt with, most of the so-called explanations of the perturbations of Uranus being altogether erroneous. The book will direct special attention to the departments of research in which astro- nomical work is now specially needed, endeavouring to attract towards profitable observation the many workers who are now wasting time in multiplying observations such as once bad special value, but now, having achieved j their purpose, possess none.",

                "full_text": "THE ASTRONOMER ROYAL AT THE MANSION HOUSE, IN LONDON. On Saturday evening the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor entertained Sir George Biddell Airy, the Astronomer Royal, at the Mansion House, on the occasion of the freedom of the City having been voted to him, when a number of gentlemen distinguished in science and the learned profession were present to do him honour. After the loving cup had been duly circulated, and the loyal toasts honoured, General Sir W. Codrington and Admiral Sir A. Milne responded respectively for the Army and Navy. The Houses of Parliament were acknowledged by Lord Talbot de Malahide for the House of Lords and Lord A. Russell for the House of Commons. The Lord Mayor, in proposing, as the toast of the evening, the health of his distinguished guest, Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, said the Cor- poration of London had often in past times conferred the honour of the freedom of the City upon men who bad distinguished themselves in the Army and Navy or by their learning and public services, and they had now determined-he thought very wisely-to confer that honour upon Sir George Airy as a man distin- guished for his scientific learning and for his devotion to scientific pursuits. So far as the City of London was concerned, no greater honour could be conferred upon any public man. Men in the Army and Navy, upon whom the freedom of the City had been bestowed, had all, more or less. distinguished themselves for their valour and the great victories they had achieved, and it could not be forgotten that those victories had been gained at the cost of many lives. But, in the ease of Sir George Airy, his victories had been over want of knowledge, and, while they had re- sulted in the greatest advantage to science, they had tended to save rather than to sacrifice human life. (Cheers.) He was Senior Wrangler at the University of Cambridge, and soon afterwards assumed the charge of the Observatory there, putting it in order in such a way that it had ever since prospered. It was now forty years since he succeeded to the office of Astronomer Royal, and he had during that long period, strenuously devoted himself to render his office a national institution, serviceable alike to science and to the public interest. Among other public objects, he directed attention to telegraphic time signals, and devoted a large amount of time and attention to the variation of the compass with refer- ence to iron ships, by which he had confered great benefit on society, and especially on the Navy and the Mercentile Marine. (Cheers.) He had taken three voyages abroad to observe total eclipses of the sun, and the last public duty which had devolved upon him in that respect was that of making preparations for the observation of the transit of Venus. To preparations for that great event he had devoted more than five years of his life (cheers) and in that way he not only found out the proper stations, but also prepared those who went to those stations for taking observations with accuracy. The Lord Mayor thought that a man who had rendered such services to his country and mankind could not be too highly honoured; and the Corporation of London had conferred upon him, in consideration of tho-ie services, the freedom of the City, the highest distinction it was in their power to bestow. (Cheers.) The freedom having been voted, the Cor- poration was now only waiting the completion of a golden casket in which to present it, and meanwhile it was his pleasing duty to offer his congratulations and those of the company to Sir George as a guest of the evening, and to propose his health, accompanied by the expression of a hope that he might long be spared to confer fresh obligations upon science and humanity. (Cheers.) The toast was received with enthusiasm. Sir George Airy, in reply, said that he hardly knew how to answer to a toast proposed in such flattering terms and with such an accurate knowledge of facts by the Lord Mayor, and which had been received with such cordiality by th9 whole company. He thought he might say that he felt the honour the Corporation had done him more than any he had ever received, and for this reason, that it had come from a body among whom he had one or two personal acquaint- ances. That honour had come to him from an official source, from a body perfectly^ independent, butwho at the same time possessed sufficient knowledge of all the duties pertaining to his office to enable them to understand and appreciate them, and all the cir- cumstances under which he stood related to the country. He therefore felt extremely the honour the corporation had determined to confer upon him. He might, perhaps, be permitted to allude to the position which th 3 Corporation of London had always held in his mind. It was the greatest and oldest of the muni- cipal bodies in the country, and he could scarcely ex- press his sense of the value and great importance of those bodies in this country and in all ages. They had always been the guardians of the inner life of England and of all political progress. (Cheers.) It was a remarkable fact that, in past times, from the Emperor Trajan downwards, it was always found that whenever absolute monarchs aimed at raising their power to a state of despotism their first effort was to suppress municipalities. England was, in his opinion, much indebted to her municipal institutions for the liberty she now enjoyed, and he earnestly hoped that the people of England would oontinue attached to those insrttutrlons; that whatever changes were made in the future they would be in no way detrimental to what had proved so useful and valuable in the past; and that the Corporation of Londen would long stand untouched in all its essentials. (Cheers.) Adverting to the position of men of science in general, he said it would be found in all cases associated with something utilitarian, and it was most fortunate that it was so. That was particularly the case with the office which he now held. He was not an astronomer more than he was a navigator; and in the office he held he had not to attend to astronomy simply, but to astronomy and navigation. He was proud to say he was oonnected with an establishment, which for two centuries had undoubtedly contributed very much to | both astronomy A,-cl navigation, and which could now boast of an observatory well-known throughout the world\u2014an institution which was maintained in a state of steady, respectable celebrity and rising fame, which no other astronomical institution had ever enjoyed. In the next place, he would say, that, although science did possess that utilitarium character, still in every branch of it, and more particularly in astronomy, it mast be founded on an education of the ftrictest order, suoh, perhaps, as'could be scarcely attained in England except at the University of which he was proud to be a member. It must, further, be founded on a severe course of education and a general knowledge of the history of astronomy, and with a determination to make something out of it. More than any other science was the study of astronomy connected with the past and with the future. Astronomy of the present day was only perfecting what was commenced many years ago, and many things connected with astronomy, so far as they had gone up to the present, would not be fully developed for many years to come. It had been agreed by common consent that the astronomy of modern days commenced in 1750, or there- abouts. A great step in advance was made at that time and what had been done ever since was really executing what was then conceived. The fact was that the full meaning of astronomical discoveries was not fully understood till the lapse of many years after they were hit upon. So it was in the past so it was at present, and so probably it would be in the future. What was done in 1750 was only now fully understood, and what was being done now might pro- bably not he entirely appreciated till the year 2000. Therefore it was essential that in the study of astro- nomy we hail to look both to the past and to the future. There was in this particular nothing similar in other sciences. Though as a rule navigators had but a poor knowledge of astronomy, it was wonderful how readily they came to understand it when they were called upon to put it to a practical test in the navigation of their vessels. As a proof of this, Sir George instanced the case of a captain of a vessel who had found, to his own great surprise, that on the strength of instructions he received, he made a most ac- curate correction of his compasses on astronomical principles. As another proof of the value of this study, the Astronomer Royal referred to a difficulty which was experienced at one time as to the drawing of a straight line in connection with military movements. It arose in this way. In consequence of the Ashburton Treaty two points were defined in reference to certain rivers, with an interval of between 60 and 70 miles be- tween them. It was ordered that a straight line should be drawn between those points. The question was how to trace that straight line from one point to the other. He, Sir Geoige, undertook to do it by astronomical problems, and he trained men of the Royal Engineers to do it astronomically. Officers were placed at the Royal Observatory to learn his methods, and they knew perfectly well what to do. The object was to go the least round-about; and they were able to lay down a rule in a certain direction, and to carry a line through forests and swamps, where the foot of man had never been before, and to carry it over 64 miles. In the end they found they were right within the breadth of a match-box. (Cheers.) After some further references to what had been accomplished by means of the study of astronomy, Sir George came to the conclusion that, after all, men of science were not so different from other men as was generally supposed. One thing they certainly did not differ in, and that was a due appreciation of such an honour as that which the Corporation of London had conferred upon himself. As he had said, he highly valued the compliment, and he begged to thank the Corporation, through the Chief Magistrate of the City of London, for the handsome manner and the circum- stances in which it had been conveyed to him. Sir George, on resuming his seat, was much cheered. The Lord Mayor, in a few appropriate sentences, proposed The Learned Societies, connecting it with the name of Dr. Hooker, President of the Royal Society, who, in reply, referred, in highly compli- mentary terms to the noble part the Lord Mayor and Corporation had played in the preservation of Epping Forest. The Health of the Lord Mayor was after- wards proposed by Mr. Cunliffe Brooks, M.P. The Corporation and'Sheriffs of London followed, to which Mr. Alderman Cotton M.P., and Mr. Sheriff Ellis briefly replied.",

The probability of communicatitng with the glowing planet Mare is much more pro- bable in these days than it was when this play was written. Astronomy teaehee u? daily, and the press is daily teaching us. that there is a.ir in Mars, canals in Mars and flowers in Mars, we know; why not human beings? Anyhow, the company at the theatre next week is prepared to prove this fact. and, if you doubt our word, come asd see for yourself. But, after all, Mars is not really vital to the object of the story, which is to furnish, in a surprising and kindly way, a much-needed lesson for the people of our own sphere.",

Montgomeryshire, a remarkable contribution to Welsh literature in the form of a book which explained in Welsh the prin- ciples of astronomy and geology. The author of the book was Edward Mills, who came from a distinguished Montgomeryshire family. By trade he was a weaver, his knowledge of as- tronomy and geology being obtained by study in his spare hours. The most curious part of the book is the illustrated plates explaining the solar system There are in all 86 plates. the work of the author's own hands. He made his own tools, which, although crude, succeeded in illustrating exactly what he wished to explain. The illustrations, showing the circular and other motions, were made out of tin, cut type high, and bent to the desired shape by home made tools. The maps of different parts of the world were also done in the same manner, a long ribbon of tin being twisted and turned over and over again, until a faithful representation of the country he desired to illustrate was obtained.",

A prominent object in the grounds was the famous observatory, erected many years ago at a heavy expense, astronomy being a hobby of Sir Henry's. The grounds ex- tend from Heme Hill to Dulwich Grove, and form a most attractive and beautiful estate. The pri- vate gardens are well kept, and there is an orna- mental lake of great beauty, to which herons and other rare birds are occasional visitors. For many years Sir Henry allowed the public access to his gardens, but this privilege was withdrawn, except in a few rare cases, owing to the damage done by a heedless crowd some years since. Sir Henry spent the evening of his life in retirement, and rarely left his beautiful home. It is worthy of note that the Prussian Patent Office refused to grant Bessemer a patent, and that no royalty was received from either Belgium or from France. Despite this, however, Sir Henry is credited with having received over \u00a31,000,000 from his invention, besides profits from being himself a successful manufacturer. Sir Henry has occupied himself with several other inventions since the completion of his steel process, amongst them being the designing of a hydraulically worked arrangement for keeping the saloons of steamers level, so as to minimise sea-sickness.",

Schiaparelli, of Milan, will go down to all time as the disooverer of the so-called \"canals\" of Mars, though he never intended to describe them as such, the word \"canal\" being a stupid mistranslation of the Italian term he used: I highly prize a letter he wrote me many years ago upon the subject. Dr\" Galle,\" of Berlin, did his great work I no less than sixty-five years ago, when he 1 discovered Neptune. He it was who picked it up at the instance of Leverrier, the great French mathematician. Our English Adams was also on the track of Neptune, but, thanks to the stupidity of the then Astronomer Royal, he missed it. They are hardly likely to repeat a blunder like that at Greenwich! These two great names are a etuxmbling- blocK to many English people. Galle is pro- nounced something like \"Golly,\" and Schiaparelli like \"Sekkaparailly,\" with the accent on the railly' \u2014a difficult word, though, after all, not so bad as the astronomer Jedzrejewicz, whose name I feel myself wholly incapable of tackling. \u25a0 A.

It will be on view at the Paris Exhibition next year. It represents the front of an Early Renaissance building, and is 15ft. high. Besides telling the time, it marks the seasons and the Church festivals, which are heralded by choral and instrumental music, as well as the song of birds. Every hour there is a procession of the Twelve Apostles before the figure of Christ, and every morn- ing and evening monks are summoned from their cloisters to chant by the sexton, who tolls the bell. Astronomy is also illustrated by a representation of the earth and moon in their orbits, and other celes- tial phenomena. EX-KING BEHANZIN OF DAHOMEY, who is languish- ing in exile at Fort de France, has conceived a fine contempt for the mulattoes who have obtained official positions under the French Government. He denies that they are a race, like the white and the black. They are, he savs, caf6 au lait, and the mixture is neither good milk nor good coffee. Chocolatwas frequently heard on the southern boulevards of Paris as applied to the coloured students, who were not- too popular, but the ex-King's expression seeips to have in it a refinement of sarcasm which might be turned to good aecount by a smart song-writer. i'ci. t.\" < i < [ ind\".j ti 1",

However, he was a, young fellow of remarkable diligence, and while work- ing in Jersey as a blacksmith he obtained an excellent knowledge of French. He sought many vocations, but at last he settled down as a porter in the employ of the Great Western Railway Company, Bristol being the scene of his first year's service. How his thoughts were directed to astronomy was a mystery he .him- self could never understand. However, all his life became centred in tho astronomical science. A man or resource, he, being unable to purchase the necessary tools, made them. While still a switchman, he produced a telescope five feet long and six inches iu diameter. This inspired his inventive genius, and he soon produced an equatorial reflecting tolescope and a remarkable camera fitted for instantaneous photography. Presently Mr Nasmyth's attention was directed to him, and ho showed him bow to make his tools. The railway man was never rendered ambitious by his success. He obtained a singular reputation in the astronomical world, and he became known as one of the most accurate of onr observers but he remained through it all a railway man, and he died station-master at Silverton, a quaint little place near Exeter.",

TO THE EDlrOR OF \"THE CAMBRIAN.\" SIR.\u2014I was extremely amused last week with the remarks in your Gossip of the Week\" column upon the Welsh Sunday Closing Act. The writer seems as ignorant of the results of this monstrous measure of monumental madness as the proverbial cow is of astronomy. In language as absurdly childish as ignorant, he endeavours to prove that Sunday Closing, instead of being an unmixed evil, is an unmixed blessing. I challenge the accuracy of his figures as to the num her of people summoned and convicted for offences against this iniquitous Act, and unless he accepts this challenge I shall deem it my duty to publish the actual figures. Sunday Closing has created more deceit and lying than even the most bitter opponents of the Act ever dreamt of. It has made more unhappy homes than half-a-dozen unjust measures put together. Cardiff has spoken v;ith no uncertain voice on this question, and I feel sure that were Swansea to get up a plebiscite the verdict would be the same as in Cardiff. When such unfair and inaccurate state- ments are made, as have been made in your Gossip of the Week upon Sunday Closing, it is time someone took up the other side. This, I trust, will be done by an abler pen than mine. Hoping my challenge will be accepted, I remain, yours truly, ANTI-HUMBUG. Hafod, Swansea, May 22nd.",

At the age of 73, Sir Robert Ball, the eminent aistronomer, passed away at the Observatory, Cambridge, yesterday. He was born in Dublin in 1840, and graduated at Trinity College. He saw Donati's comet in 1858, and on Nov. 13th, 1866, he witnessed the famous star shower, which only lasted for a couple of hours in the middle of the night. He was at that time working with Earl Ro-se, whose celebrated 60ft. telescope, with a 6ft. aperture, thougi2 built in 1845, was the Jargest in exis- tence until 1905. In 1883 he witnessed the gorgeous sunset which he attributed to the cubic miles of pumice dust vomit- ted, into the air by the Krakatoa erup- tion After his first appointment he mounted two 6teps at a time. A mathematical professorship at Dublin was followed by his appointment as Astronomer Royal for Ireland. In 1892 he left his native city to become Lowa- dean Professor of Astronomy and Geo- metry at Cambridge. Sir Robert's lecturing tours at homl and in America were planned when he was at the Irish observatory, and it was there that the majority of his books were written. During his lecture tours he visited Swansea on more than one occasion. He gave up lecturing three years ago.",

Recorde was versed in many arts and sciences. More than 350 years have passed since Recorde's death, and he has been without a memorial in the town of his birth. The medallion is the work of Mr Owen Thomas, sculptor,, of London, himself an old Tenby boy, and is executed from a painting of Recorde which is in the possession of the Rev. W. Done Bushell. Mr Thomas expressed a wish that the tablet should be placed in the old church, with which lie was associated in his boyhood, and the Rector has given his consent to this being done.",

The sky was clear, the moon shone brightly, and was surrounded by thousands of stars which twinkled in all directions. Presently the dark shadow, professed to be that of the earth, began to cover the eastern side of the moon, and in half an hour's time the whole \"disc was obliterated, and there was immediately a profound darkness.

He once occupied the post of Astronomer- in-Chief to the late Maharajah of Cashmere. He translated several works in astronomy from English, Sanskrit, and Arabic, and he had perhaps the finest astronomical library in India. He was so much esteemed as an astronomer that the Maharajah was anxious to build an observatory for him, but was pre- vented by the great expense. He wrote an analytical work on Urdu grammar, and also some lyrical pieces. He has left behind him an autobiography which cannot fail to be interesting. During the mutinies of Delhi he was in command of a native force, and showed himself to be both a loyal and a brave subject of the Queen. Subsequently he took an active part in prison, educational, and other reforms in the native State of Puttiala, as Well as in the Punjaub. The history of Kanh Singh, who, although a Sikh warrior by birth, gained so many laurels in the walks of peace, is full of instruction. It is worthy of remark that he gave to an American missionary the credit of his education.",

Professor Roberts, F.R.S., the distinguished astronomer in charge of Crowborough Observatory, Ion the Sussex side of Tunbridge Wells, died suddenly on Sunday afternoon on going indoors from the Observatory gardens. The deceased, who was seventy-five years old, was the author of many scientific works. Dr. Roberts was born in Denbighshire in 1829. A large part of his life was devoted to practical investigations in geology, microscopy, spectrum analysis, astronomy, and other kindred branches of science, He was the author of several papers on geological and astronomical subjects. For several years he pursued stellar photography with powerful instruments specially constructed for the purpose, and succeeded in adding considerably to the knowledge of the stars, clusters and nebulie. He devised a method and a machine by which the stars that have been photographed can with accuracy be engraved directly from the negatives on copper plates for the purpose of printing; the machine is also adapted for measuring the positions and magni- tudes of the stars. In 1870 he was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society, and of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1882. In 1890 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and was also A member of other learned bodies.",

Among the most important researches which astronomers have in hand is an in- vestigation of that period of minute oscilla- tion of the earth's axis, which gives rise to the phenomena of variable latitude. Upon co-ordinating several hundred Indian Ocean determinations with corresponding results of the Berlin Observatory, Professor Foer- ster, of Berlin, finds that beyond doubt the latitude in Berlin during the period in- creased by one-third of a second, and in- creased in the Indian Ocean by exaetly the same amount. As long ago as 1876 it had been put forth that irregular motions of the earth's axis to the extent of half a second may be produced by the TEMPORARY CHANGES OF SEA LEVEL, due to meteorological causes. Professor Foer- ster points out the need of four permanent stations for regular and continued observa- tions of this change in latitude, and so to de- termine the causes of those variations, which have hitherto been put down to irregularities in observations. Not only is the research of the first importance in respect to the funda- mental observational work in astronomy, but it has exceeding interest in connection\" with tidal, meteorological, and geological observa- j tions and speculations.",

English and German, intended for exploration of the vast southern territory of ice. The Gauss is a German ship, and the Discovery a British one. Every- thing that shipbuilding art and science can suggest to enable these missioners of science to resist the conditions likely to be en- countered in an antarctic voyage has been made available in their construction. The scientific equipments of the vessels will not be less perfect than the various details re- lating to build and sailing. The general public are slow to appreciate the great value to science which such expeditions are calculated to represent. There are many details relating to astronomy, geology, physics, meteorology, and other departments of research which can only be authoritatively settled by the knowledge gained from expedi- tions of this kind. The interests of all sciences ire so clearly interwoven, that the advance of one often means the forwarding of all; and the expectation that the Antarctic expeditions will throw light on many problems of physical science, is at least a fair inference drawn from aur experience of research in the opposite region of the world.",

On Wednesday last, a lecture on astronomy was delivered in the National School-room, by Mr. Hemming, which, owing to the unfavourable state of the weather, failed to attract a large company. On Friday, Mr. Hemming repeated the lecture, which afforded great satisfaction to the audience he has since visited Abbey Tintern. where there was a good attendance of the working class, with whom Mr. H. is quite at home his manner of delivery, assisted by various dia- grams, seemed to be properly appreciated bv the sons of toil. He is proceeding through Monmouthshire', and there is but little doubt of his success, especially as his terms for admission are very moderate. Upwards of \u00a3150 were expended among the drapers of Chepstow during the past week, in supplying the members of the clothing club with warm and comfortable clothing. There is a good and useful society established in the town, to aid and encourage the poor in the act of saving a trifle weekly, to be laid out in such necessaries asjare required for the winter season. There is a dangerous custom prevalent in this town,\u2014that of setting fire to the soot in chimnies, instead of having them properly swept at intervals. Among other nuisances that are in the course of removal here, it is hoped that this dangerous practice will receive a check. Parties neglecting to cleanse their chimnies on proper occasions are amenable to taw but they are not allowed to do so at the risk of their neighbour's property.",

Fortunately for the proprietors, a man who was passing the shop observed the smoke in the shop, and gave an alarm to the inmates of the house. Mr. Evans, who happened to be in, with the aid of some others, very soon succeeded in putting the fire out. The fire is said to have arisen from a young lad having left a burning candle on a sack of flour. The only damage done was the burning of one sack and one oask of flour, a sack of oatmeal, and a few empty sacks.

                "full_text": "ABSEGAVEUNY. THE FLAT WORLD.\u2014O11 Monday and Tuesday, the lfitli and 17th instant, a person named Goulden, in his perigrina- tions through the country, as an enlightener of the public mind upon the I'.rr'vs of M.idcni Astronomy, took Abergavenny in his course, and hired the Cymreigyddion Hall, issued hand- bills, inviting an audience to hear his denunciations of modern science, and then engage in a promiscuous discussion on the merits of his hypothesis\u2014which was, in fact, a revival of those antiquated views of Astronomy, entertained by our ancestors, which science has exploded. After going through a rhapsody which he designated a lecture, in which he en- deavoured to prove that the world was a fixed plane or disc, and not globular\u2014that the sun was a body moving in an elipsis over its surface at the height of lUoO miles, and that the inoou moved round the snn in concentric circles; that the stars were all so many luminous specks in the heavens\u2014 none of them more than 4000 miles from the earth. His theory was that the earth was round like a wheel, the nave of which would represent the North Pole, and the felloes the South\u2014that from the North extended, in every direction, im- mense shoals of Ice, and that from the Periphery shot forth continents of Ice and unknown lands\u2014midway between these was the Equator. Such was the audacity of this empiric in science, that he denounced, as ignorant, Newton and Boyle, as well as Dr. Chalmers and Sir John Herschell- and had the impudence to assert in his bills, that a paper drawn up by himself on this subject, had been read before the Royal Astronomical Society in December Jast. In a discus- sion which followed the delivery of his nonsense\u2014his igno- rance of the nature of the liubject was exposed by some well- timed and appropriate questions put to him by a gentleman present (a mere youth,)\u2014and to prove that lie was a mere babbler upon what he presumed to be a lpcture-he talked largely of wliat Sir John Franklyn said and did when traversing the Southern Seas. Though he failed to convince his audience that the world was Hat, he did his best to prove that those who had any thing to do with him in Abergavenny, were not so sharp as they ought to have been\u2014for he managed to leave the proprietors of the hall, his landlord, the printer, and the bill-sticker minus. Mr. Owen delivered a very interesting lecture in the Cymreigyddion Hall on Wednesday last, on Scripture His- tory and illustrated his theme by a vast variety of dissolving views. He will also deliver lectures on Astronomy on Thurs- day and Friday, May o and 4, in the same place; when it is hoped there will be a large attendance. It is annoueced that Mr. Popham, F.A.S., late of Win- chester college, who has lately been lecturing on Astronomy 111 1 ontypooi, Newport, Cardiff, Merthyr, and Tredegar, will visit our town on Monday, the '.50th instant. He brings with him, astronomical apparatus of the first order; and after an absence of ten years (for ten years ago he lectured in the old church to large and delighted audiences on the same subject) the face of an old friend is looked for with somewhat like pleasing anticipations and from what is said of his improve- ment, in the art of lecturing, disappointment is out of the question. CEICKHOWELL.\u2014On Monday evening last, a meeting was held at the Calvinistic Methodist chapel, for the purpose of petitioning the Legislature, in favour of arbitration, instead of war. Arthur Gabell, Esq., was called to the chair; and the meeting was addressed by the Rev. John Lloyd, Wes- leyan minister; F. Franco, Esq., surgeon; E. Parry, Esq., surgeon and several other gentlemen. The meeting was well attended, and at the close nearly all the parties present signed the petition. After a vote of thanks to the chairman, for his able conduct in tho chair, the meeting separated.",

Schoolboys who are inclined to complain of the hard lines, as thej consider then!, that fall to their share, should lead about the almond- eyed learners in the Flowery Kingdom, and then rejoice that they have such an easy time of it in comparison. The Chinese school children have instilled into them at an early age habits of hard, steady study. At the age of five a boy begins his schooling. At daylight he rises and after dressing as quickly as possible, he starts break- fastless to school. He is assigned a task, and after it is completed he is allowed an hour for breakfast; again, later, lie has an hour for luncheon, but he is at his study for nearly twelve hours a day, seven days in the week. All this time, when lie is not reciting his lessons, he is studying aloud at the top of his voice. He is under the eye of his master both in school and on his way to and from school. The lad is taught rudimental astronomy, physics, and natural history, but greater stress is put upon writing and his literary studies. \"A Thousand Letters,\" a poem, is the study that forms the backbone of his literary educa- tion. In it are taught the duties of children to parents and all such matters. Whatever the study may be, history, classics, or science, every lesson is learned and repeated word fo word.",

It seems to have been at night that IJbt piety of the Psalmist was awakened by thic contemplation when the moon and stars wen visible, and not when the sun had riien in bit strength, and thrown a splendour around hint which bore down and eclipsed all the leaser glories of the firmament. And there is much in the scenery of a nocturnal sky to lift the soul tc pious contemplation. That moon, and theat stars, what are tbey ? They are detached from the world, and they lift us above it. We feci withdrawn from the earth, and rise in lofty abstraction from this little theatre of human passions and human anxieties. The mind abandons itself to reverie, and is transferred in the ecstasy of its thoughts to distant and unex- plored regions. It sees Nature in the simplicity of her great elements, and it sees the God ot Nature invested with the high attributes of wisdom and majesty. DB. CHiUfm.",

The volumes include some by Admiral Smytb. which have a special interest not only because they are I now vory soatce, but because Smyth (an ances- tor of Baden-Powell's) resided for some time at I Cardiff. The admiral was the first antbor who really ga.ve an impetus to .'maieur observational astronomy in our islands. Amongst the other valuable books are work\" in French, German., and Italian, the whole constituting a gift of the atmost importance to the praotieai observer. The Chairman commented warmly on the generosity of Archdeacon Bruce, and a hearty vote of thanks, was accorded him on the motion of Miss Rule, saconded by Mr Conta, of Newpoxt. It was decided to take sacb measures as would place the arcbdeacon's valuable gift, as I well as the rest of the society s property, in permanent. keeping at Cardiff Central Library for convenient reference by tho public. It may be added that the fine telescope geuerousiy presented to Cardiff by Dr. Frunkton Evans (and which, it is hoped, will by and by be erected at Cathays Park) was once the property of Archdeacon Bruce. j",

Mr Arthur Mee, F.R.A.S., presided. A large number of ladies and gentle- men were elected members of the society, and five candidates were proposed. Mr Charles T. Whitmell, M.A., H.M.I., submitted and ex- plained an interesting model of an equatorial stand, which he had devised himself, and which was practically tested by the members outside the building. Mr Whitmell also gave some interesting data, such as the length of the local degree, the time taken by the sun in apparently sweeping across Cardiff and the like. A discussion ensued. A short paper on \"Solar Observation,\" con- tributed by Miss E. Brown (director solar section, B.A.A.), was read and much appreciated, and, in the course of the conversation that followed Mr Waugh (headmaster, Cardiff Higher Grade School) mentioned that he was in the habit of getting his elder scholars to observe the sun through the school telescope, and plot down on ptepared discs the progress ot the spots from day to day. The scholars took much interest in the work. A series of drawings by members was handed round, and observations reported, includ- ing a meteor seen in Pembrokeshire, which made a crackling noise. Professor Tanner kindly con- sented to give members who dasired it an insight into the elementary mathematics of astronomy. It was mentioned that the Cardiff Exhibition authorities would like a telescope and house to figure amongst the exhibits next year.",

I happened to be awake at 3.20. on the morning in question, and, looking out of my window, saw what appeared to me to be an enormous ball of fire, which seemed to be very agitated before it settled down, in a few minutes, into a steady glare. The star, or whatever it was, appeared in the north-east; it had none of the appearance of a comet, but still had a kind of forked tail. At about four o'clock it suddenly seemed to divide, and then the whole disappeared in a second, leading the other smaller stars in the field looking ashamed of themselves. I know nothing about astronomy myself, and cannot tell what it was but having had my night rest disturbed (for which I disturbed others in the house), I should at least like to know what had disturbed it. Perhaps some of your readers can enlighten me. I am yours, etc., F. W. C. Llanstephan Vicarage.",

Professor Pepper, in his recent lectures at the Royal Polytechnic, stated that Dr. Bedford has propounded entirely new theories of astronomy, which are most pro- found and very interesting, and well worthy of being studied and very interesting, indeed, these theories must be, to all who were at all alarmed at Professor Pepper's intimation that our world might be destroyed at any moment by some comet falling into the sun, and so increasing its heat as to burn us all to death. In support of this terrifying suggestion, he quoted the opinion of Sir Isaac Newton, that Aucke's comet was getting nearer to the sun at every revolution, and would ultimately fail into the solar orb and produce the said awful result; but, for the consolation of the superstitious, Professor Pepper advised his andieace to read Dr. Bedford's theo ries, which are quite opposed to the great mathemati- cian's opinion. The doctor sturdily disbelieves in the possibility of the destruction, of our earth by an erratic comet, and explains the uttef impossibility of any csi- Vision of ths .ae&estial bodies.",

The boom in Antarctic expeditions has been practically marked and realised by the launch- ing of the two vessels, English and German, intended for exploration of the vast southern territory of ice. The Gauss is a German ship. and the Discovery a British one. Every- thing that shipbuilding art and science can suggest to enable these missioners of science to resist the conditions likely to he en- countered in an antarctic voyage has been made available in their construction. The scientific equipments of the vessels will not be less perfect than the various details re- lating to build and sailing. The general public are slow to appreciate the gi eat value to science which such expeditious are calculated to represent. There arc many details relating to astronomy, geology, physics, meteorology, and other departments ot research which can only be authoritatively settled by the knowledge twined from expedi- tions of this kind. The interests of all sciences are so clearly interwoven, that the advance of one often means the forwarding of all: and the expectation that the Antarctic expeditions will throw light on many problems of physical science, is at least a fair inference drawn from our experience of research in the opposite region of the world.",

The Welsh Wesleyan body have sustained a great loss in the death of the Rev Owen Williams, who died at his residence, Bryn Aber, Carnarvon, on Tuesday night, after a few days illness. A paralytic seizure on Fri- day morning rendered the condition of the rev gentleman practically hopeless from the beginning. He was in his 78th year, and was one of the oldest ministers in the connexion; he was also at one time among the most powerful preachers on theWelsh circuits. Mr Williams was a native of Llanddyfnan, Anglesey. He enteied upon the work of his first circuit in 1856, and be- came a supernumerary in 1890. His published works included a Welsh edition of the New Testament, which he bad translated direct from the Greek. Besides theology his favourite studies were law and astronomy. His library was made up largely of law books. He sat for several years on the Carnarvon Board of Guardians and the Carnarvon School Board, of which he was vice-chairman% and he was also a member of the Free Lib- rary Committee. A man of an independeofc turn of mind, his opinions were always highly prized by ministers and laymen in the Wesleyan connexion. He leaves a widow with whom much sympathy is felt,",

Perhaps it was the same \"Glory of the Lord\" or miraculous light which \"slione round about the shepherds,\" which may have appeared to the Magi on the same night, at a great distance, diminished to the size of a star.\u2014Dr. Halts.

He is succeeded by his nephew, Mr Ernest Beckett, Conservative member for the Whitby division of Yorkshire. Deceased was well known for his restoration of St. Albans Cathedral and other churches in the neighbourhood, and was the author of several publications on clocks, architecture, and astronomy. A HUNTSMAN'S MEMORIAL.-The golf course which has been laid down on Ellerbeck Common, near Caldbeck, in memory of John Peel, the famous Cumberland huntsman, was formally opened last week by Mr. Banks, of Highmoor, Wigton. Golf links seem a strange memorial to a sportsman of renown, but they may be a means of attracting some people to \"John Peel's country.\" On the fringe of the Cumberland hills, to the north of Skiddaw, the course is laid at the foot of Brae Fell and High Pike. Within 10 minutes' walking distance is the house at Greenrigg where Peel was born in 1777, and equidistant is Rutbwaite, which was Peel's home for 45 years. The course covers over 100 acres The nearest railway station is six miles off, and whether this isolation will prove a blessing to the Calderbeck Golf Club remains to be seon.",

Mr. Owsn, of Aberga- venny, informs me that he noticed it with the naked eye on Friday evening, but being very busy did not pay any further attention to the matter. Mr. Owen and his brother both take great interest i- L astronomy, and have an. ex- cellent telescope. Had they reported at one what they saw the honour would have fallen to Monmouthshire, for the star was not officially recorded till the following night. It i3, however, o recorded till the following night. It is, however, of scientific interest to know that it was cer- tainly visible before then.\" We learn that it was Mr. Edwin Owen who observed the star. He was casually looking at the heavens and noticed a star which at the time he took to be Altair, though it struck him that it was more brilliant and up earlier than Altair. Had he been observing a little later, when Altair was visible from the garden, or had he been in a less encloesd space and had a more extensive view of the heavens, he would at once have realised the significance of the appearance and would have had the honour of being the first to officially report it. The star has during the past few days lost a good deal of its former brilliance. A.",

The men declare that they make the revelation because Dr. Cook only paid them 260dols. Captain Loose declares that he supplied twenty-four altitudes for latitude sights and a chart covering the entire route from Svartevaag to the North Pole. In the chart he marked down all the points which the ex- plorer was assumed to have reached in his Po)ar journey, and he made sixteen observa- tions such as could be taken at the Pole. Besides the foregoing observations, Cap- tain Loose and Dunkle, it is stated, provided a set of books on navigation and astronomy and a number of navigation charts. Dr. Cook has not yet had any chance of denying the allegations, and his place of con- cealment remains a secret.",

Such studies as these gave man a fuller and deeper sense of the majesty and power of the Father whom all worshipped, and a deeper sense of the greatness of liim who had created these things and allowed us to enjoy a knowledge of them. He trusted that, as time went on, studies of this character would flourish, and that God would unveil more and more of the greatness of His works, and more and more allow the minds of men to partake of the enjoyment of His wonderful majesty.

A., of Trinity College, Dublin. I iit-h Edi- tion, revised up to the present time, by the Rcy. L Tomlinson, )'LA.; Routlcdge, Farnngdon-strcct. 18.51. English popular science scarcely needed the transla- tion of a foreign work on elementary astronomy, Sir John Ilerschei's book, which lays a thorough founda- tion for the theory of Astronomy, together with Dr. Lardner's, which incorporates all the amusing part of astronomical observation, by describing the physical constitution of the different worlds, nearly exhaust all that can be required on tho subject. X enrthclcss, the distinguished name of M. Arago may lead some per- sons to prefer this book to some of our English works but thev will find it better adapted for a school treatise than for the perusal of those who, having acquired a general knowledge of the subject, wish to extend it by the help of the lucid exposition of a great French as- tronomer. The book is loss diihonlb OJK! less thorough than Sir John Ilerschei's work, which is almost too difficult for a mere begiuner and it is much less com- prehensive and minute than Dr. Lardner's. It is, how- ever almost too technical for the class of readers for whom it is designed, and we arc somewhat disappointed that the great characteristics of French learning lucid exposition and happy arrangement-scarcely seem, to characterise the work before us in any remarkable de- gree. If any of our readers should unwarily havc pur- chased this cheap little book for railway perusal, and feel aggrieved at not finding in it the amusing qualities of Dr. Lardnel\"\u00a3 works on the same subject, we recom- mend him to turn to the portion on the comets, which he will probably pronounce readable even in a railway carriage. Indeed, the study of comets is quite an ex- citing science. The planets, which were wanderers\" (as their name implies) to the ancients, are quite dull and domestic to us. Everybody knows what they can do, and where they must go. The planets are only tame omets\u2014those whose physical nature has assumed a permanent shape, and whose orbit is so strictly in. variable that little more interest can be felt on their account by the gazers after celestial wonders. Comets, M. Arago defines as celestial bodies which describe an eclipse of such an eccentricity as to cease to be visible during a part of their revolution.\" Etymolo- gically they are hairy stars, and, in point of fact, they arc the Esaus of the Heavens\u2014so eccentric in their habits that no one knows when a comet may come first within our field of observation, though it may have been scouring the sky as long as the earth has been turning on her axis, and so liable to material changes of constitution that occasionally they are scarcely to be recognised on a second arrival. For in- stance, there is one little comet discovered in 1770, which, from the attractions to which it has been sub- jected, had so changed its orbit that no one knew it again when it came back. The same irregular star has since changed its path so much at every revolution, owing to the powerful influence of Jupiter upon it, as to baffle the vigilcnce of our astronomical watchmen and quite evade identification. The story of comets,\u2014what they are, what they might do, what they may have done, what their tails acet may do, and may have done,\u2014is quite the romance of astronomy. We have very little accurate know- ledge,\" says *-Af. kra-o, \"respecting the tails of comets.\" Indeed, Hcrschel says, \"There is beyond doubt some profound secret and mystery of nature concerned in, the phenomenon of their tails.\" This is the definition of the different parts of a comet:\u2014 \"The widens of a comet is the central point, which is more or less lustrous. The nebulous light surround- 1 I ing the nucleus is called in French the elicvalure, or the hair. The lumi nous trams by h comets are ac- l mnmous rams >y,11e most etg are ac- companied, were formerly called beards or tails, ac- cordingly as they preceded or followed the comet in its line of march. At present they are called tails, what- ever be their position. \"Lastly, the nucleus and the chovelurc together, constitute the head of the comot.\"",

For a penny the purchaser can obtain a handy little pamphlet, printed with good type on capital paper, giving the names and politics of each member of Par- liament, the county, university, borough or city, that he represents, with the number of the electors and the populations of each constituency in the years 1861 and 1871. These simple facts are the highest praise that could be awarded to so cheap a produc. ti@n, which is certain to have, as it well deserves, a broad-cast circulation. THE DAY OF REST.-The current number of this magazine commences the new year with a decided improvement in the style of its woodcuts, several of the ill-drawn and defaced German blocks being re- placed by newer designs from an English, pencil. Mr R. A. Proctor, whose books on astronomy are deser- vedly famed, contributes a couple of articles on \"Light\" and\" Space\" which will be found well- worthy of perusal. Mrs. Fllen Ross, the author of a \"Candle Lighted by the Lord,\" commences a pro- mising sorial story entitled \"Dora's Boy;\" while Airs. O'Reilly contributes the opening chapters of The Story of Ten Thousand Homes in a very in teresting style.

Tennyson's words, tho fairy tales of science,\" applied by him to the discoveries made in the natural world more than hctif a century ago, are most aptly descriptive of the information furnished by Prof. Dewar, in his lactures on \"Chemical Action of Light,\" delivered to juveniles at the Royal Institu- tion. Professor Dewar, in his concluding exposition, chiefly dwelt on certain phenomena in connection with some solid bodies after their subjection to the action of light. Brilliant and successful as was the series of experiments performed to illustrate one of the most remarkable discoveries in the pro- gress of modern science, those points in the lecture were not more interesting than the lecturer's state- ments respecting the beautfulj practical applications which had been made of the discovery. It had, and would, greatly enlarge the resources of photographic art, and facilitate the arrangement for taking photo- graphic pictures, and would be of peculiar value in etching and printing processes. In drawing attention to the more recent and subtle developments in photo- graphy, Professor Dewar took occasion to point out its services as an auxiliary in the investigations of the student of science. This feature in the history of the art was fully illustrated by the lecturer, who indi- cated the obligations of science to it, respectively in astronomy, electricity, optics, and even physiology, as evidenced in the\" photo\" pictures which have been obtained of minute organisms in living bodies, and believed by more than one eminent scientist to be germs of disease.",

The men declare that they make the revelation because Dr. Cook only paid them 260dols. Captain Loose declares that he supplied twenty-four altitudes for latitude sights and a chart covering the entire route from Svartevaag to the North Pole. In the chart he marked down all the points which the ex- plorer was assumed to have reached in his Polar journey, and he made sixteen observa- tions such as could be taken at the Pole. Besides the foregoing observations, Cap- tain Loose- and Dunkle, it is stated, provided a set of books on navigation and astronomy and a number of navigation charts. Dr. Cook has not yet had any chance of denying the allegations, and his place of con- cealment remains a secret.",

I The oldest picture-book of all was designed nearly 5000 years ago by a people dwelling somewhere between \u00c6gean and the Caspian, which domesticated the bull, the sheep, the goat, the dog, and the horse which hunted the bear, the lion, and the hare, and used the bow and the spear. Yet a people not merely nomadic, but either maritime themselves or at least acquainted with the ocean and with naviga- tion. They had made not a little progress in astronomy, for they had determined the length of the year, and had carried the science of observation so far that they could recognise the position of the sun relative to the various ecliptic group of stars. Their religion, says a writer in the Nineteenth Century Magazine, involved the erection of altars and the rite of sacrifice. They were acquainted with stories of the Fall and of the Deluge substantially the same as those preserved to us in the early chapters of Genesis, and they devised many of the constellations to give appropriate and permanent record of them, no doubt because they were included, as with ourselves, in their sacred history. The people was an organised one, having some definite and recognised authority, whether king, priest, patriarch, or Council does not appear; but of that authority the work of constellation-making received beyond doubt the express sanction.",

                "full_text": "SIR ROBERT BALL, LL.D. THE Gilchrist Lectures in Llangollen have brought prominently under notice at the very first stage of the series a noted scientist and astronomer in the person of Sir Robert Stawell Ball. This gentleman was born on July 1st, 1840. His scholastic career was a distinguished one, and gave healthy promise of the matured and popular lecturer we listen to with so much interest to-day. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1857, and in 1861, after a dis- tinguished undergraduate course, took the degree of Bachelor of Arts, obtaining at the final examination two senior moderatorships (with gold medals), one in mathematics, the other in experimental and natural science, and being elected to the mathematical studentship of the year. His first important step in an astronomical career was in 1865, when he became the late Lord Rosse's astronomer at Parsonstown. In 1887 he was appointed to the Professorship of Applied Mathematics and Mechanism in the Royal College of Science, Dublin, an institution founded for the purpose of giving instruction in such branches of science as are applicable to the industrial arts. His first work, Experimental Mechanics,\" published in 1870, contained the substance of a special course of evening lectures delivered in that college for the benefit of artizans and others who were unable to attend the ordinary classes. In 1872 he took the degree of LL.D., and in 1873 became a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1874 he was elected Andrews' Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin, and Royal Astronomer of Ireland. In 1876 he published his \"Theory of Screws,\" which attracted much attention by its originality, and the mathematical powers ex- hibited in it. The author gave an account of the theory, under the title of \"A Dynamical Parable,\" to the British Association at Man- chester, and this has been translatod into Italian and Hungarian. It was principally for this work that he received the Cunningham Gold Medal of the Royal Irish Academy, which was awarded to him in 1879. It was in the year 1884 that he published an elaborate treatise on astronomy-his pet subject-in which he gave a popular exposition of the most recent develop- ments of science. The year 1886 was a memorable one for him, inasmuch as his attain- ments had become so far recognised in the world of science that he was rewarded with the dignity of knighthood. The object to which Sir Robert Ball has principally directed his observations as Astronomer Royal is the in- vestigation of Annual Parallax. Attention was first attracted to his abilities as a public lecturer by an address dellvered at the opening of the Midland Institute in Birmingham, entitled \"A Glimpse through the Corriders of Time.\" He has since become well known by his lectures on astronomy in various parts of the United Kingdom. He has for many years lectured, chiefly to artizans, under the auspices of the Gilchrist Trust; and this is a work in which he is understood to take special pleasure. A little volume, Starland,\" published in 1889, contains the substance of a course of lectures delivered two years before to young people at the Royal Institution. He has also published a singularly interesting and learned work, In Starry Realms.\" Sir Robert Ball's genial temper and frankness of character, and, it may be added, the vein of kindly humour with which he is endowed, have made him a general favourite, as was witnessed the other night at Llangollen. In addition to the other offices mentoined above, he is president of the Zoological Society of Ireland, scientific adviser to the Commissioners of Irish Lighthouses, a member of the Council of the Astronomical Society, a vice-president of the Royal Irish Academy, a member of the Council of Trinity College, Dublin, one of the trustees of the National Library of Ireland, an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and an honorary member of the Cambridge Phil- osophical Society. In 1892 Sir Robert Ball was appointed Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry in the University of Cambridge. This is surely a record to be proud of; and he may not yet have reached the top of the scientific tree-a laudable ambition.",

He once occupied the post of Astronomer- in-Chief to the late Maharajah of Cashmere. He translated several works in astronomy from English, Sanskrit, and Arabic, and he had perhaps the finest astronomical library in India. He was so much esteemed as an astronomer that the Maharajah was anxious to build an observatory for him, but was pre- vented by the great expense. He wrote an analytical work on Urdu grammar, and also some lyrical pieces. He has left behind him an autobiography which cannot fail to be interesting. During the mutinies of Delhi lie was in command of a native force, and showed himself to be both a loyal and a brave subject of the Queen. Subsequently he took an active part in prison, educational, arid other reforms in the native State of Puttiala, as well as in the Punjaub. The history of Kanh Singh, who, although a Sikh warrior by birth, gained so many laurels in the walks of peace, is full of instruction. It is worthy of remark that he gave to an American missionary the credit 01 his education.",

Mr Arthur Mee, F.R.A.S., presided. A large number of ladies and gentle. men were elected members of the society, and five candidates were proposed. Mr Charles T. Whitmell, M.A., H.NLI., submitted and ex- plained an interesting model of an equatorial stand, which he had devised himself, and which, was practically tested by the members outside the building. Mr Whitmell also gave some interesting data, such as the length of the local degree, the time taken by the sun in apparently sweeping across Cardiff and the like. A discussion ensued. A short paper on \"Solar Observation,\" con- tributed by Miss E. Brown (director solar section, B.A.A.), was read* and much appreciated, and, in the course of the conversation that followed. Mr Waugh (headmaster, Cardiff Higher Grade School) mentioned that be was in the habit of getting his elder scholars to observe the BUB. through the school telescope, and plot down on prepared discs the progress ot the spots from day to day. The scholars took much interest in th4 work. A series of drawings by members Waf handed round, and observations reported, includ- ing a meteor seen in Pembrokeshire, which made, a crackling noise. Professor Tanner kindly con- sented to give members who desired it an insight; into the elementary mathematics of astronomy. It was mentioned that the Cardiff Exhibition authorities would like a telescope and bouse to figure amongst the exhibits next year.",

It is perhaps the most beau- tiful piece of spirit-painting in existence. There are in all 70 figures in the work, including the Apostles, the Virgin, St. David, St. Michael, and St. Joseph. It was the fact that the National Gallery authorities gave \u00a3 70,000 for the Marl- borough Raphael that induced the owner of the I- Reconciliation to investigate the history of his treasure.",

SIR,\u2014Jusb now, when so much is being said iu disparagement of the Celtic fringe, it may be well to recall the eulogies of impartial critics. Emerson, speaking of the ancestors of the Eng- lish\u2014Celtic, German, and Norman-says, \"They are of the oldest blood of the world\u2014the Celtic. Some peoples are deciduous and transitory\u2014 where are the Greeks ? Where the Etrurians ? Where the Romans ? But the Celts, or Sidorides, are of an old family, of whose beginning there is no memory, and their end is more remote in the future, for they have endurance and productive* ness. They planted Britain, and gave to the seas and the mountains names which are poems, and imitate the pure voices of nature. They are favourably remembered in the oldest records of Europe. They had no violent feudal tenure, but tbo husbandman owned the land. They bad an alphabet, astronomy, priestly culture, and a sublime creed. They have a hidden and pre- 'carious genius. They made the best popular literature of the middle ages in the songs of Merlin, and the tender and delicious mythology of Arthur.\" This is only one of many eulogistic references to < the Celts. It is rather late in the day, therefore, to attempt a serious disparage- ment of the fringe and above all to endeavour to arouse dormant racial antipabhies is the name -of a spurious Unionism.\u2014I am, &c., PHIL.

Mr Lanerdon, the self-made astronomer,\" as ha was known throughout Devonshire, was the son of a farm labourer. His education was acquired in the Sunday school. However, he wat a young fellow of remarkable diligence, and while work- ing in Jersey as a blacksmith be obtained an excellent knowledge of French. He sought many vocations, but at last he settled down as a porter in the employ of the Great Western Railway Company. Bristol being the scene of his first year's service. How his thoughts were directed to astronomy was a mystery he him- self could never understand. However, all his life beeame centred in the astronomical science. A man of resource, he, being unable to purchase the necessary tools, made them. While still a switchman, he produced a telescope live feet long and six inches in diameter. This inspired his inventive genius, and he soon produced an equatorial reflecting telescope and a remarkable camera fitted for instantaneous photography. Presently Mr Nasmyth's attention was directed to him, and he showed him bow to make his tools. The railway man was never rendered ambitious by his success. He obtained a singular reputation in the astronomical world, and he became known as one of the most accurate of our observers but he remained through it all a railway man, and he died station-master at Silverton, a quaint little place near Exeter.",

Mr Everitt pre- sided. Sir William met with a flattering reception, and delivered an interesting ad- dress on \"The charm of Science.\" Science, he considered, was divided into three great classes, firstly experimental, embodying chemistry and electricity; secondly, and the most important, styled observational, and thirdly the branch known as applied science or engineering. Regarding me- chanics he considered the bicycle or tricycle the most beautiful scientific apcaratus. He commendetl the study of astronomy, and drew special attention to the shower of meteors to be noticed on November 14th, 15th, and 16th next. Referring to the wonderful application of science he traced the construction of roads, railways, tele- graphy, and the telephone. Regarding telegraphy, he said it was truly marvellous the'way in which news was disseminated all over the world, as instanced by the daily press, particularly when by its means on the Thames Embankment thousands of persons on the previous day were enabled to view an exact reproduction of the great yacht race in America. He hoped the' pre- sence of the telegraph wires between here and the Cape would bring some petople to their senses, as everyone hoped war would be checked and peace restored.",

THE WEATHER PROPHET OF HOLYHEAD. \u2014In answer to a correspondent respecting thefRoberts' family of Holyhead, R )li, i-t Roberts was a son of John Lewis Robens, or Shon Robert Lewis, according to his bardic name. He was also an astronomer, poet, and preacher with the Independents. He was the composer of the two first verses of the well-known hymn, Braint, braint, Yw cae! cymdeithas gyda'r Saint.\" His son, Robert, wrotea book on geography and astronomv, and went about the country lecturing on astronomy. He ex- hibited the working of the solar system by a machine which he had himself invented. He was a well-educated man, and had been a tutor in an academy in London before settling in Holyhead. Any other particulars would be gladly received. J. ROBERTS.

The various clergymen and several other gen- tlemen in the neighbourhood, have kindly promised their assistance, and it is to be hoped that the vast number of young men who have much time to spare will take advantage of this opportunity to improve themselves. Last Friday evening, Dr. Hughes, Bethesda, attended the school, and delivered an address to the scholars, in which he adduced several examples of men, who, by employing their Leisure Hours,\" rose to great emi- nence, and therefrom be drew the inference, that what had been done, other things being equal, might be done again. The address was attentively listened to. At the conclusion, the Rev. J. Evans, the rector, pro- posed a vote of thank< to the lecturer, and expressed a wish that Mr. Hughes would favour the scholars with another lecture, which Air. Hughes kindly promised to do.",

But to make the school more suitable for adults, a monthly lecture forms part of the routine to which the public are admitted free, and they have likewise the privilege of bringing with them a friend to hear the lecture. The course of lectures willembrsce various subjects such as electricity, astronomy, and physiogmany; these will be treated in a simple, intelligent manner, at once instructive and enter- taining. The various clergymen and several other gen- tlemeu in the neighbourhood, have kindly promised their I aSSL\"tance, and it is to be hoped that the vast number of young men who have much time to spare will take advantage of this opportunity to improve themselves. Last Friday evening, Dr. Hughes, Bethe^da, attended the school, and delivered an address to the scholars, in which he adduced several exmuples of men, who, by employing their Leisure (lours,\" rose to great emi- nence, and therefrom be drew the inference, that what had been done, other things being equal, might be done again. The address was attentively listened to. At the conclusion, the Rev. J. Evans, the rector,, pro- posed a vote or thanks to the lecturer, and expressed a wish that Mr. Hughes would favour the scholars with: another lecture, wllich Mr. Hughes kindly promised to do.",

Price, M.A., the newly ap- pointed Vicar of Bangor, delivered an astronomical alec. ture in the National School-room on Tuesday evening last. The lecture was illustrated by a powerful magic lantern, and the views were altogether excellent. The rev. gentleman spoke of the various theories respecting the revolution of the heavenly bodies, and alluding to the opposition which Copernicus met with for asserting that the earth revolved round the sun. He said that the Bible was written not to teach astronomy, geogra- phy, nor any other science, but the way of salvation to man. The lecturer spoke for nearly two hours, and throughout the whole of the time the large audience was very attentive. The Rev. J. Evans, the Rector of the parish, proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. Price for his able lecture, which was heartily responded to. We understand that this is the last lecture which Mr. Price will deliver in these parts as Incumbent of Glanogwen, and that the lecture was delivered to keep a promise made previous to his promotion. The rev. gentleman had already delivered his farewell sermon to his own people on Sunday evening, but up to the last his labours have been unremitting, and he leaves the neighbour- hood with the warm wishes of the people amongst whom he has so successfully laboured for a number of years.",

The map of the heavens which the international astronomers, now assembled at the Paris Observatory, are taking steps to prepare, will be composed of from 1800 to 2000 sheets, and will give an exact impression of all the groups of stars. A new impetus will thence be given to the science of astronomy, and it will be possible for astronomers to study the distribution of the stars and perchance the constitution of the uni- verse. So Admiral Moucbez and his friends are thus, it will be seen, engaged in a most important work, the value of which may be gathered, in a great measure, from the fact that they will be able, by means of the new and improved instruments which are used at the Paris Observatory, to diagnose, if such a term can be employed, the 100,000,000 of stars which, according to the statistics compiled, exist in the firmament. Admiral Mouchez states that, with the aid of the immensely improved apparatus, heavenly objects were plainly visible, such as Maia, one of the Pleiades, which had hitherto escaped the observation of astronomers and it is hoped that the same instruments will enable further progress to be realised, and that accurate and clear photographs will be taken on an extensive scale.",

Tennyson's words, the fairy tales of science,\" applied by him to the discoveries made in the natural world more than h<*lf a century ago, are most aptly descriptive of the information furnished by Pror. Dewar, in his lectures on \"Chemical Action of Light,\" delivered to juveniles at the Royal Institu- tion. Professor Dewar, in his concluding exposition, chiefly dwelt on certain phenomena in connection with some solid bodies after their subjection to the action of light. Brilliant and successful as was the series of experiments performed to illustrate one of the most remarkable discoveries in the pro- gress of modern science, those points in the lecture were not more interesting than the lecturer's state- ments respecting the beautfull practical applications which had been made of the discovery. It bad, and would, greatly enlarge the resources of photographic art, and facilitate the arrangement for taking photo- graphic pictures, and would be of peculiar value in etching and printing processes. In drawing attention to the more recent and subtle developments in photo- graphy, Profeasdr Dewar took occasion to point out its services as an auxiliary in the investigations of the student of science. This feature in the history of the art was fully illustrated by the lecturer, who indi- cated the obligations of science to it, respectively in astronomy, electricity, optics, and even physiology, as evidenced in the photo pictures which have been obtained of minute organisms in living bodies, and believed by more than one eminent scientist to be germs of disease.",

At its conclusion he remarked that it was one of the greatest gratifications a rational being could enjoy to hear the works of God so described. Snch studies as these gave man a fuller and deeper sense of the majesty and power of the Father whom all worshipped, and a deeper sense of tha greatness of him who had created these things and allowed us to enjoy a knowledge of them. He trusted that, as time wen ton, studies of this character would flourish, and tha I God would unveil more and more of the greatness of His works, and more and more allow the minds of men to partake of the enjoyment of His wonderful majesty. The discoveries of recent years were wonderful, and the sights now revealed raised man in the scale of being, making them better under- stand themselves and Him who was the source of all things.",

Sir John Lubbock, the president, in his inaugural address, dwelt upon the progress of different branches of science during the past half century. Over and above the im- mense accumulation of facts, we have, he pointed out, the theory of evolution, and no one would question the immense impulse which Darwin had given to the study of natural history. We now know that the stripes of the tiger have refer- ence to life among the jungle passes, that the lion is sandy like the desert, and that the markings of the leopard resemble spots of sunshine glancing through the leaves. Man's I existence has been carried back to a distance of time which changed our view of ancient-history. Great light has been thrown on the correlation of forces, and the conservation of energy and in astronomy the spectrum analysis is discovering t-o us the composition of the heavenly bodies.

Especially is this true of those in modest circum- stances who cannot employ efficient cooks. Burnt fingers, sour bread, soorched roasts, leathery steaks, wishy-washy coffee, and disordered stomachs are not conducive to the happiness that one imagines the honeymoon should be filled with. There are so many reasons, logical and philosophical, why cooking should be included I in the accomplishment of young girls that it is useless to enumerate them. Good cooking is the basis of happiness, health, and success in the home life. One may thoroughly understand art, music, architecture, science, and philosophy, be familiar with astronomy, mythology, the my teries of evolution, politics, and literature, yet. if the chemistry of a loaf of bread has been neg- lected, the education is sadly incomplete, so far as the 'hottse mother' is concerned.\"",

It is our pleasing duty to record that another Cardiff man has been similarly honoured. Mr H. W. Lloyd Tanner, F.R.A.S., professor of mathematics and astronomy at the University College of South Wales, has just been elected F.R,S. We believe we are correct in stating that Mr Lloyd Tanner is the only mathematician of the year to have thus attracted the appreciative notice of the Council of the Royal Society. We congratulate the Professor upon his well-earned distinction, and the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire upon possessing two Fellows of the Royal Society in the ranks of its officers-a. unique record for any scholastic institution in the Principality. It is interesting to know that the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge\u2014to gi /e the association its full title- was founded so far back as 1645, the charter of incorporation passing the Great Seal in July, 1662. The Royal Society holds the foremost place among the scientific bodies of England, not only from the number of eminent men included in its fellowship, but also from its close official connection with the Government. =-",

The following report was laid before the Senate of the University College at their last meeting \u2014 In accordance with an arrangement made by the Senate. I delivered a course of lectures on Astronomy at the Soyal Institution of South Wales, Swansea, during the Lent Term. An examination was held at the end of thecourse. Upon the resulis of that examination, and taking into account the class work shown up, I recom- mend that the College certificate shonld be awarded to each of the students whose names are given below in alphabetical order :Mr. F. J. U. Carulla, Miss Agnes Cawker, Miss Adelaide Hall, Mrs- Huxham, Mr. Coamore Johns. Miss J. A. Madge, Miss S. Madge, and Mr. W. Terrill. The classes preceding the lectures were largely attended, and several students, besicies those who took the examination regularly, did the class work set from time to time. The work thus shown up was most satis- factory, and it was evident that considerable time and thought had been given to the exercises. In conse- quence of this I was able to carry the work to a higher stage than would otherwise have been possible. The examination has fully confirmed the impression derived from the class work. H. W. LLOYD TANNER. April 21, 1886.",

Arthur Stanley as candidate at the General Election.\" He has been treated ever sines aa tho adopted candidate, and no after- thought of sophistry will avail him to wriggle out of the awkward position. His election expenses date from the day of his adoption, more than twelve months ago; that is the penalty ho and his supporters pay for their bungle. Mr. Mond, we suppose, will be turning round next, and assevera- ting that he was never \"adopted\" by the Radicals of Chester. Radical candidates are, we know, very wonderful people, but they cannot alter facts, and their mere assurance that the moon is made of green cheese would not seriously affect the settled principles of the science of astronomy.",

At the age of five a boy begins his schooling. At daylight he rises, and, after dress- ing as quickly as possible, he starts brcakfastless to school. He is given a task, and after it is completed he is allowed an hour for breakfast. Again, later, he has an hour for luncheon; but he is at his study nearly twelve hours a day, seven days in the week. All his time, when he is not reciting his lessons, he is studying aloud at the top of his voice. He is under the eye of his master, both in school and on his way to and from school. The lad is taught rudimentary astronomy, physics, and natural history, but greater stress is put upon writing and his lite- rary studies. A Thousand Letters,\" a poem, is the study that forms the backbone of his lite- rary education. In it are taught the duties of children to parents and all such matters. What- ever the study may be-history, classics, of science\u2014every lesson is learnt and repeated word for word.",

It has been viewed by the best known English art connoisseur in the trade, and by him its minimum value is placed at E12,000, at which figure he is prepared to treat as its reserve price. There is a history attaching to the painting, which was for a long time looated in Spain, and has since been 200 years in the family from whom Mrs. Vignolles acquired it. We understand that Mr. Vignolles is willing- even anxious-to afford his fellow-townsfolk an opportunity of viewing this magnificent specimen of the great Italian master before it is removed to London, and it has been proposed that it shall be exhibited in the public library gallery but this, we believe, will not now be done, a more suitable room being required.",

To the Editor of tne \"western mall E1ir-F:;Ol1l the remarks made at caraJa Council meeting yesterday in reference to the telescope so kindly given by Mr. Frankleu Evans, one might imagine the gift was not appreciated by the members of the corporation. Such is not'the case. The fact of the mliter is that this is a most valuable instrument, and one that requires a lot of looking after. We have no funds to meet this expenditure, or to construct a building suitable for its reception, and, therefore, I suggest its location should V crnsidcred in the plan8 of the new buildiL? for the university college, one of the turrets of which might be made stro g enough to have it mounted in Then it would be at ,he dispoal of the men who could make the edt use of it.

Now that sconce of evfery kind becomes common property a society of this character meets a real want. In Wales there existed nothing of the kind befdrfe. There were several persons who made astro- nomy their chief study, but, like the stark abdv^, each turned in his own orbit, retard- IdSfc of the movements of his neighbours. Now they may be brought together into a system, which is only another word for society, and by their united efforts they will be able to prosecute their studies to a much better purpose. The president of the new mdremeOt is Mr. Arthur Mee, who is a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, and one of the vice-presidents Principal Viriamu Jones. All who feel interested in the work of astronomy are invited to join. The roll of members has already reached eighty, and, as the subscription (two shillings and sixpence) is small, there is no reason why the institution should not receive general favour.",

It was the most interesting of the kind, and fullest of inform- ation about the construction of the globe, &c., I everread. It Was full alsooi figures: the position, for instance, of each of the planetsof our system in relation to the sun was given. As to size, it would he a little larger than Cornwall's \"Geography for Schools,\" and somewhat smaller than Ewing's \"Geography and Astronomy.\" Judging from its size and cover, it would be a two shilling book. The title-page was gone when I had the loan of it. I feel prdtty sure that many of our students in colleges, and schoolmasters especially, have seen and read it. If anyone will furnish me with the name of the publisher, or sell me the little book, I should feel, greatly obliged.-I am, dec., tunnarthen. COLUMBUS.",

There is some doubt as to whether the Leonids will be bril- liantly seen this year, hecause it is next year I they are really cluc, and also because, as the earth cuts through the swarn, our hemisphere may not be to the front, and so we shall miss the display. Still, if the weither be clear, there is a chance. Watch should be kept after eleven o'clock to-night, principally towards the east.

Well, another considerable meteor- shower is expected, and we are told that the best timo to watch is in the night between Wednesday and Thursday next. This parti- cular meteor-swarm is known as the Andro- medes, because its members appear to radiat-a from a point in the constellation Andromeda that lies near Cassiopeia (the W group). These particular meteors have a very slow movement (different from the Leonids), and are, there- fore. mncli more easily observed and recorded It seems almost superfluous to add that meteors are shooting-stars, but at the time the Leonids were due, though the skies were hlank. iots of people at Cn rdjff stated how much they enjoyed the \"display,\" which turned out to be the distant glare of the Dowlais and Melin- griflith When the sky is overcast, no astronomical observations of any kind are pos- S'ble. By th:- way, when the \"Daily Tele- graph\" spoke of every available telescope being brought to bear on the shooting-stars, it did not display it knowledge of astronomy to con- spicuous advantage.

A cheerful, intelligent face is the end of culture, and success enough. For it indicates the purpose of Nature and wisdom attained. When our higher faculties are in activity, we are domesticated, and awkwardness and discomfort give place to natural and agreeable movements. It is noticed that the considera- tion of the great periods and spaces of astronomy induces a dignity of mind, and an indifference to death. The influence of fine scenery, the presence of mountains, appeases our irritations and elevates our friendship. Even a high dome, and the expansive interior of a cathedral, have a sensible effect on man- ners. I have heard that stiff people lose something of their awkwardness under high pilings, and in spacious halls.

He said he knew all rules of 'rithmetic; Yes, he could write, but did not care to try; He knew that throw a brick would rhyme to \"stick He knew potatoes boil, and bake, and fry.

Several friends have already expressed to me their interest in such a movement, and we have a number 01' gentlemen here identified either with the Royal Astronomical Society or the British Astronomical Association, whilst the ivimber of the general public interested more or less in the science must be large, judging from the continuous run that exists on the astrono- mical works at the Cardiff Free Library.

Modern astronomy (thanks to the patient and unwearying researches of Mr. Denning, Bristol, and some others) has classified the various meteor shoyvers, and it has been also proved that there is a close relationship between comets and meteors\u2014in fact, if the earth were to pass through the tail of a comet we should probably witness phosphoric glows and brilliant showers of shooting stars. The meteors of November 13 move in an orbit. and are more condensed in some portions of it than others.; when, then, the earth crosses such a deJIse region we have a brilliant shower of meteors, at others a less marked display. These par- ticular meteors are called Leonids, because they seem to radiate from the direction of the bright star Gamma Leonis, which, be it :s,oted. does not rise till midnight. Sometimes (but somewhat rarely) meteors reach the ground in the form of huge masses, jorne of which are in our museums. We have to thank our air that it acts as a friendlv cushion\u2014protecting us from what would otherwise be an aerial bombardment of terrific violence. ARTHUR MEE, F.R.A.S.",

If this (Tuesday) evening he clear, our readers may possibly be rewarded by tite sight of a brilliant shower of meteors\u2014at least, so we learn from No. 4 of the \"Cambrian Natural Observer,\" the issue of which has followed with something like meteoric swiftness on the heels of No. 3. The \"Observer\" contains valuable papers on the Leonid shower by Professor John- stoue Stoney, Mr. W. F. Denning, F.R.A.S., and Mr. Carslake Thompson (president of the Astro- nomical Society of Wales). There is some doubt as to whether the Leonids will be bril- liantly seen this year, because it is next year they are really due, and also because, as the earth cuts through the swarn, our hemisphere may not be to the front, and so we shall miss the display. Still, if the weather be clear, there is a chance. Watch should be kept after eleven o'clock to-night, principally towards the east. Careful notes of the meteors seen, of their number, and the direction of their paths may be of some service to astronomy.",

About 50 years ago there was published in Llanidloes, Montgomeryshire, a. remarkable contribution to Welsh literature in the form of a book which explained in Welsh the prin- ciples of astronomy and geology. The author of the book was Edward Mills, who came from a, distinguished Montgomeryshire family. By trade he was a weaver, his knowledge of as- tronomy and geology being obtained by study in his spare hours. The most curious part of the book is the illustrated plates explaining the solar system. There are in all 86 plates, the work of the author's own hands. He made his own tools, which, although crude, succeeded in illustrating exactly what he wished to explain. The illustrations, showing the circular and other motions, were made out of tin. cut type high. and bent to the desired shape by home made tools. The maps of different parts of the world were also done in the same manner, a long ribbon of tin being twisted and turned over and over again, until a faithful representation of the country he desired to illustrate was obtained.",

Williams, Board of Trade surveyor, Cardiff, who passed away on Saturday, after a long and tedious illness. Mr. Williams was a man high in the esteem and respect of his col- leagues, and his loyalty to the service kept him at his duties long after mortal illness had seized upon hia frame. He was a genial and faithful friend, and much sought after by a large circle of acquaintances. He was also a staunch and uncompromising Church- man. Mr. Williams took the deepest interest in scientific pursuits. For some yeare he devoted himself to astronomy, and distin- guished himself by the care no less than the variety of his observations, and by the beauty and correctness of his drawings, for he waa a- facile and expert artist. He was a member of the British Astronomical Association and of the Astronomical Society of Wales, and did active work for both associations. Mr. Williams was a clever photographer, and very ingenious in the manufacture of home- made apparatus. He delighted to go to the root of things, and had his valued life been spared he would have distinguished himself in many directions. Mr. Williams leaves a widow and two sons, for whom widespread sympathy is felt in their affliction.",

                "full_text": "DEATH OF LORD GRIMTHORPE I The Yorkshire Evening Poet\" to-day announces that Lord Grimthorpe died at Bitchwood, St. Albans, this morning. Deceased, who was a son of Sir Edmund Beckett-, Bart., was born in 1816. He suc- ceeded to the baronetcy in 1874, and was tpade a peer in 1886. He is succeeded in the peerage by his nephew, Mr. Ernest Beckett, Conser- vative member of the Whitby Division of the North Riding of Yorkshire, for which he has sat since 1885. Lord Grimthorpe was well known for his restoration of St. Albans Cathedral and other churches there, and was the author of several publications on clocks, architecture, and astronomy. The announcement- this morning of the dea-th of Lord Grimthorpe, whose successor is Mr. E. W. Beckett, member for the Whitby Division, has caused much excitement throughout the constituency. The Liberals have no candidate, Ur. Beckett's seat as Unionist member having been considered impregnable. The Conservatives have now to look out for a candidate, a contingency for which they were unprepared. Lord Grinrthorpe's death wae sudden though expected. About a week ago his lordship had a fall, and this occasioned a shock. He was attended by his local medical adviser, who called in a specialist. Chi Friday Lord Grinythorpe was in a p&rtially comatose con- dition, and he died, as stated, this morning from heart failure, no member of the family I being present at the time.",

This is very ingenious, but it is not new, and, of course, it has the obvious drawback that used stamps obliterated on the one half might be de- tached and the other half used, thus rob- bing the Post Office. Still, if this could be safeguarded, the new idea would be an undoubted convenien\u00e9e. The late Dr. Andrew Common, F.R.S., was one of the many examples of eminent men who are not at all successful on the platform. Like the soldier, \"deeds not words should be their motto.

I Sir Robert Ball, Lowndean, Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge, stated yesterday that the great daylight comet first discovered at Johannesburg on Monday was almost cer- tainly a new comet. It was not one of those known to astronomers to the best of their present belief, but until a few more observa- tions had been obtained of it they could not say decidedly. It takes three ob- servations of a comet to show exactly its orbit,\" Sir Robert remarked. and until thajt, is obtained the identity of the comet is uncertain. The tail of the comet last night was 2deg. long, which will perhaps be more easily understood by saying that it appeared to be about four times the diameter of the I full moon. Sir Robertaid that the comet most oertainly could be seen with binocular glaesets. The observer should look at Venus, now so unmistakable an I object in the twilight sky at sunset, and at the horizon under Venus, and then along towards the north.",

WINKS, CARDIFF.] A pretty close acquaintance with the large mass of popular literature devoted to the fascinating science of astronomy had prepared the writer for pleasant surprises in the way of cheap books on this subject. But he hardly expected anyone, even in these days of science for the million,\" to supply as much material for the money as Mr. Mee has done in this second edition of his Observational Astronomy.\" When the first edition appeared the question went round among readers who knew something of the cost of production in connection with books of this kind, How can it be done at the price except on principles that are benevolent rather than business-like ?\" It was no solution of the difficulty to be told in the words of the old lady who informed her customers that the multiplication of individual losses beyond a certain point amounted to an aggregate gain, i.e., as she put it, We lose by every one, but it's the number that pays.\" Still the wonder grew,\" and grows yet more and more with this second edition. For here we have additional matter, and I know not how many fresh illus- trations, from the clever design which adorns the cover down to the charming little thumb- nail portrait sketches of astronomical worthies. I cannot say t/hat the latter are always flattering (what do the admirers of Dr. Ball think?), but they are as unmistakable as the drawings of Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars in the portrait gallery of the planets. While the illustrations are under notice it may be well to pay our tribute of regard to them as a whole, and pass on to speak of the contents of this admirable and useful vade mecum for the astronomical observer. First of ail, these illus- trations, take them as a whole, are a vast im- provement on those of Edition No. 1. Some of the latter never satisfied anybody, least of all the editor, who is known to be an excellent draughtsman and a severe critic upon his own work and its reproduction. Now that they are gone and the field is clear, we have scarcely any- thing in this marvellously cheap little book that is not very. good of its kind. Some of the process blocks are delightful. I am told there is no better half-to le work done in any office in the kingdom than that which is often turned out in the photo-engraving department .\u00a1f the \"Western Mail.\" With such specimens as the five blocks which make up the handsome fron- tispiece before me, I can well believe this assertion. Look, for example, at Weinek's photographs and drawings of the lunar craters Hansteen and Gassendi; at M. Antoniadi's and Mr. Pratt's photographs of Saturn, the one showing the Northern and the other the Southern Pole of the planet, and the upper and under side of his rings. In addition to these, let the reader examine the delicate fea- tures of the photographs reproduced on pp. 7, 9, 17, 45, 46, 55, 57, 62, 65, and 69, &c. Cer- tainly, the \"Western Mail\" deserves well of all those who take pleasure in downright good artistic work. It is, surely, matter for con- gratulation that we have no need to go to London for book illustrations when process printing can be executed in such a. style as this in our own town. The reader will be pleased to note, in addition to these capital illustrations, the clear type and good setting of the letterpress, and the pleasant appealance of \"Ile book generally. H is a comfort to handle a book of this kind, and the reading of It is made as easy as may bs \u00ceor eyes that have seen their best days. On turning to examine the contents of the book one must keep its title in mind, and not look for that which the name \"Observational Astronomy\" does not promise. If the reader wishes for a complete view and acsount of all that goes under the nILme of Astronomy he must look elsewhere; and in doing so he will find ample guidance in this book to other books which d*al with the sun, moon, pianets, comets, stars, and star systems :n a more comprehensive and exact manner. But here one is supposed to be a.n observer asking, What is there for me to look at, and how am 1 to look? Mr. Mee answers these simple questions of the beginner and the amateur admirably. Many a..devoted student of the heavenly bodies who has fought aud worked his way through the first difficulties of this great science will wish that such a book as this might have fallen into his hands years ago. And no one is forgotten in the wide provision offered in these pages. The youth who has no instrument a.t all, and nothing but his own eyesight to work with, is started on his naked patb. The observer who comes into the arena armed with an opera or field glass is pleasantly told how to use it. and what wonders he may see. The aspirant after a telescope is taken in hand next in order, and nourished and brought up after a fashion it does one's heart good to see. The history of the telescope is given him for an appetiser, and no sooner despatched than the proper meal begins. As an encouragement to go on to the end we have a likeness of our kind host set before 11\", stand- ing bareheaded beneath his Calver, with one of his most contented guests looking on. What could be better? We see the goal toward which we are being led if only we will take our leader's capital advice. In this we have all we need to know, and much more than we could have ex- pected, anent refractors and reflectors, object- glasses, and specula, and eye-pieces, and tele- scope stands, arid al! the equipments needful for cne who begins with a l \u00a3 hi., and works up by varying stages of 2in., 3in., 4in., or Sin. object- g-Iasses; or soars away into higher realms where 6in., Bin., and lOin. or 12in. reflectors hold sway. It is a really admirable piece of work-- this direction given by our author as to the purchase and use of a telescope. As is most natural, Mr. Mee figures best under Reflectors,\" but no one who loves the lefrac'.or best has any right to complain of neglect. We have in this part of the book some f-xcellent pictures of tele- scopes, which ought to bring many a purchaser to certain houses that have been wise enougn and kind enough to lend their blocks for publi- cvl inn. The special chapters on the moon and the planets are full of interest. Of these we like the moon, Jupiter, and Saturn the best. It is well known that Mr. Mee knows his way about the moon as well as most astronomers of the B.A.A., and is prepared at any time to conduct a cir- cular-tour-party round the solar system as soon as ever the means of locomotion are provirlpd and the preliminaries of peace are settled between us and our Martian neighbour. In securing the valuable cn-r>ne>*3tinn of distin- guished writers in different departments, Mr. Mee has been most fortunate. Captain Noble, Messrs. N. E. Green, W. F. Denning, J. E. Gore, E. M. Antoniadi, Edwin Holmes. &c., have all contributed to the contents of the book after a manner that adds immensely to its value. Their kindness in this matter cannot b3 too highly esteemed and appreciated. It is a pleasure aiso to notice the substantial aid which the author has received from gentle- men of local reputation in Cardiff. Among these special mention must be made of Mr. C. T. AAHiitmell, Mr. Atkinson, Mr. Latt.ey, Mr. J. Duckworth, and Mr. Cars- lake Thompson. The chapter on the ever- memorable Prebendary Webb is invaluable. Its main fault is its brevity. One can never hear !\u2022 too much of so good a man, and so exact an observer and so excellent a writer as the dear old Celestial Objects Webb.\" He is quite as celestial as any of the objects, and, indeed, more so. If there were space and a mind for criti- ciftn I would say that a good deal of the matter under several heads, e.?., \"Telescopes,\" \"Obser- vation,\" &c., might with advantage be differently arranged and made more coherent and conse- cutive. Now and then articles of great interest on a common thpme are separated by a wide interval (see pp. 30-1 and 38-9; and, again, p. 96.) It would have hff\u00bbn 1\\11 a^vntitage also if Mr. Denniog's invaluable appendix could have followed p. 93 Now and then a line or two of explanation would have been very .welcome. Ta.ke one example only. Lord Crawford's simple method for working an alt-awmuth instrument on equatorial lines\u2014see p. 27\u2014is not made clear to every reader even by means of this admirable little drawing. In the next edition-which we trust may soon appear Mr. Mee will, perhaps, tell his unlearned readers a little more particularly what a micrometer is\u2014p. 31\u2014and give up the mock suns at Llanstephan\u2014p. 6\u2014in favour of the Gegenshein \"\u2014p. 7. What the Gegenshein is our kind author does not think it needful to explain: he does not even tell ua tha1- it is \"made in Germany.\" But he does tell us a thousand things we are glad .to learn or to be reminded of, and for his admirable way of telling them amateur students and observers owe him a thousand thanks and much more than half-a-crown in hard cash. To 611 those who are interested in Astronomy and/ thirk of buying a telescope, I would say, Buy'the book at cnce. In its line it is by far the completest and cheapest book in the market.

                "full_text": "Science of the Heavens. REVIEW OF lHR ARTHUR MEE'S WORK ON ASTRONOMY. HOW PROCESS BLOCKS ARE MADE IN CARDIFF. [BY THE REV. W. E. WINKS, CARDIFF.] A pretty close acquaintance with the large mass of popular literature devoted to the fascinating science of astronomy had prepared the writer for pleasant surprises in the way of cheap books on this subject. But he hardly expected anyone, evtn in these days of science for the million,\" to supply as much material for the money as Mr. Mee has done in this second edition of his Observational Astronomy. When the first edition appeared the question went round among readers who knew something of the cost of production in connection witn books of this kind. How can it be done at we price except on principles that are benevolent rather than business-like?\" It was no solution of the difficulty to be told in the words of the old lady who informed her customers that the multiplication of individual losses beyond a certain point amounted to an aggregate \u00a7{*in> i.e., as she put it, We lose by every one, but it's the number that pays.\" Still the wonder grew,\" and grows yet more and more with this second edition. For here we have additional matter, and I know not how many fresh J^us\" trations, from the clever design which adorns the cover down to the charming little thumb- nail portrait sketches of astronomical worthies. I cannot say that the latter are always flattering (what do the admirers of Dr. Ball think?), but they are as. unmistakable as the drawings of Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars m the portrait gallery of the planets. While tue illustrations a'/e under notice it may be well to pay our tribute of regard to them as a whole. and pass on to speak of the contents of this admirable and useful -vade mecum for the astronomical observer. First of all, these illus- trations, take them as a whole, are a vast i111- provement on those of Edition No. 1. Some of the latter never satisfied anybody, least of an the editor, who is known to be an excellent draughtsman and a severe critic upon his own work and, its reproduction. Now that they are gone ancf the field is clear, we have scarcely any- thing in this marvellously cheap little book that is not very good of its kind. Some of the process blocks are delightful. I am told thai 3 is no better half-to le work done in any oihee in the kingdom than that which is often turned out in the photo-engraving department of the \"WAPITI Mail.\" With such specimens as the five Docks which make up the handsome fron- tispiece before me, I can well beiieve ibis assertion. Look, for example, at Weinek s photographs and drawings of the lunar craters Hansteen and Gassendi; at M. Antoniadi's and Mr. Pratt's photographs of Saturn, tile one showing the Northern and the other the Southern Pole of the planet, and the upper and under side of his rings. In addition to these, let the reader examine the delicate fea- tures' of the photographs reproduced 011 pp. 7, 9. 17, 45, 46, 55, 57, 62. 65, and 69, &c. Cer- tainly, the \"Western Mail\" deserves well of all those who take pleasure in downright good artistic work. It is, surely, matter for con- gratulation that we have no need to go to London for book illustrations when process printing can be executed in such a style as this in our own town. The reader will be pleased to note, in addition to these capital illustrations, the clear type and good setting of the letterpress, and the pleasant aplye-iance of the book generally. It is a comfo'-t to handle a book of this kind, and the reacting of it is made as easy as may be for eyes that have seen their best days. On turning to examine the contents of the book one must keep its title in mind, and not look for that which the name \"Observational Astronomy\"- does not promise. If the reader wishes for a complete view and account of all that goes under the name or Astronomy he must. look elsewhere; and in doing so he will find amp^e guidance in this book to other books which deal with the sun, moon, planets, comets, stars, and star systems :n a more comprehensive and exact manner. But here one is supposed to be an observer asking, What is there for me to look at, and how am 1 to look ? Mr. Mee answers these simple questions of the beginner and the amateur admirably. Many a devoted student of the heavenly bodies who has fought and worked his way through the first difficulties of, this great science will wish that such a book as this might have fallen into his hands years ago. And no one is fWotten in the wide provision offered in these pages. The youth who has no instrument at all, and nothing but his own eyesight to work with, is started on his naked path. The observer who conies into the arena armed with an opera or field glass is pleasantly told how to use it. and what wonders he may see. The aspirant after a telescope is taken in hand next in order, and nourished and brought up after a fashion it does one's heart good to see. The lustory of the telescope is given him for an appetiser, and no sooner despatched than the proper meal begins. As aft encouragement to go on to the end we have a likeness of our kind host set before us, stand- ing bareheaded beneath his Calver, with one of his most contented guests looking on. What could be better? We see the goal toward which we are being led if only we will take our leader's capital advice. In this we have all we need to know, and much more than we could have ex- pected, anent rc-fractors and reflectors, object- glasses, and specula, and eye-pieces, and tele- scope stands, and at! the equipments needful for one who begins with a liiu., and works up by varying stages of 2in., 3in., Aiii., or Sin. object- glasses or soars away into higher realms where 6iu., 8in., and lOin. or 12in. reflectors hold sway. It is a really admirable piece of work-- this direction given by our author as to the purchase and use of a telescope. As is most natural, Mr. Mee figures best under Reflectors,\" but no one who loves the iefraclor best has any right to complain of neglect. We have in this part of the book some r-xcellent pictures of tele- scopes, which ought to bring many a purchaser to certain houses that have been wise enougii and kind enough to lend their blocks for publi- cation. The special chapters on the moon and the planets are full of interest. Of these we like the moon, Jupiter, and Saturn the best. It is well known that Mr. Mee knows his way about the moon as well as most astronomers of the B.A.A., and is prepared at any time to conduct a cir- cut ar-tour-party round the solar system as soon as ever tha means of locomotion are provided as ever tha means of locomotion are provided and the preliminaries of peace are settled bs'uWesn us and our Martian neighbour. Iu securing the valuable co-oneration 01 n- guished writers in different department.s. Mr. Mee has been most fortunate. Captain Noble, Messrs. N. E. Green, W. F. Denning, J. E. Q-ore, E. M. Antoniadi, Edwin Holmes. &c., have all contributed to the contents of the book after a manner that adds immensely to its value. Thsir kindness in this matter cannot be too htohly esteemed and aopreciated. It is a \u00b0 pleasure also to notice the substantial aid which the author has received from gentle- men of local reputation in Cardiff. Among these special mention must be made of Mr C. T. Whitman. Mr. Atkinson, Mr. Lattey, Mr. J. Duckworth, and Mr. Cars- lake Thompson. The chapter on the ever- memorable Prebendary Webb is invaluable. Its main fault is its brevity. One can never hear too much of so good a man, and so exact an observer and so excellent a writer as the dear old\" Celestial Objects Webb.\" He is ouite as celestial as any of the objects, and, indeed, more so. If there were space and a mind for criti- cism I would say that a goodi deal of tha matter under several heads, <?.. \"Telescopes,\" \"Obser- vation,\" &c., might with advantage be differently arranged and made more coherent and conse- cutive. Now and then articles of great interest on a common theme are separated bv a wide interval (see pp. 30-1 and 38-9; and, again, p. 96.) It would have been a\u00ab advantage also if Mr. Denning's invaluable appendix couid have followed p. 93 Now and then a line or TWO of explanation would have been very welcome. Take one example only. Lord Crawford's simple method for working an alt-azimuth instrument on equatorial lines-see p. 27-is not made clear to every readec even by means of this ad ratable little drawing. In the next edition\u2014which we trust may soon Appear- 1\\'1> Mee will, perhaps, tell his unlearned readers a little more particularly what a '\u2022 micrometer is-po 31\u2014and give up the mock suns at Hanstephati\u2014p. 6-in favour of the \"Gegenshein\"\u2014p. 7. What the Gegenshein is our kind author dope not think it needful to explain; he does not even tell us tha1' it is \"made in Germany.\" But he does tell us a thousand things we are glad to learn or to be reminded of, and for his admirable way of telling them amateur students and observers owe him a thousand thanks and much more than half-a-crown in hard cash. To all tnose v'ho are interested m Astronomy and thirfc of buying a telescope, I would say, Buy the book at once. In its line it is by far the conipietest and cheapest book in the market.

Towers, a well-known Swansea ehipbroker, and a past member and captain of the Swansea Rugby fifteen, died on Friday morning from paralysis of the brain. Mr. Towers was only 42 years of age, and was of eoneiderable physical strength. He came to Swansea in 1885 as manager for Messrs. James Wood and Co.. shipowners and brokers, and afterwards entered into partnership with Mr. \"Wedlabe as Wedlake, Towers, and Co. He recently had litigation with a tugboat-owning firm for which he had acted, and the non- success of this appeared to have preyed on his mind. He married the eldest daughter of the late Mr. William Thomas, builder, and leaves a widow and two children. MR. JAMES REES, J.P., LLANDOVERY. We regret to announce the death of Mr. James Bees, J.P, of Talgarth, near Llan- dovery, which took place at Grove House, Llandovery, late on Thursday evening. The deceased, who was 73 years of age. had been in indifferent health for some considerable time. He was a zealous member of the Llandovery Board of Guardians and District Council for a lengthy period, being chairman of the latter body for several years. He also represented Cilycwm parish on the Carmarthenshire County Council. MR. F. J. DENDY, CARDIFF. General regret was expressed at the Cardiff Docks on Monday when the news of the death of Mr. F. J. Dendy, of the firm of T. P. Thomas and Co., coal exportere, &c., became known. Mr. Dendy, \"ho became partner in the firm some time ago, was one of the most highly eeteemed young men at the Cardiff Docks. He was only 36 years of age. and was formerly manager for j^esers. D. Radford and Co. His death took place at his residence, Addiscombe House, LlandaiF. He was taken ill at the office on Friday after- noon, and was ordered home by a medical adviser. On Sunday night Dr. Fred Evans and Dr. Cornelius Griffiths performed an operation to remove an obstruction of the rtomach, and from the effect of the opera- tion he failed to rally. Mr. Dendy, who was a. brother of Mr. Dendy, wine and spirit merchant, Charles-street, Cardiff, was a. native of Gilwern, near Abergavenny, and leaves a. widow and a. little girl. MR. J. PRICE, YSTALYFERA. The remains of Mr. John Price were con- veyed by the first train from Pontycymmer on Monday for interment at Ystalyfera. The deceased lived at Ystalyfera, but had spent a few weeks at Pontycymmer with his sister, Mrs. Voyle, thinking the change might improve his health. The deceased was 34 years of age. CAPTAIN WILLIAM NOBLE. F.R.A.S. The death is announced, at an advanced age, of Captain William .Noble, F.R.A.S., of ITclffield, Sussex. He served in the Rifle Brigade, but devoted the greater part of his life to astronomy. For 40 years he contri- buted to the \"English Mechanic\" above the signature \"A Fellow of the Royal Astro- nomical Society.\" His valuable help was ever at the service of students of science every- where, and, as a solitary instance, it may be mentioned that he revised the proof-sheets of both editions of Mr. Arthur Mee's \"Observa- tional Astronomy,\" published by Ike \"Wes- tern Mail.\"",

This is a thousand pities, and we must hope that the movement hack to the land\" will brin? in its train a revival of popular astronomy- i Venus is at present a resplendent! eight, and the watcher will naturally think she is proportionately more beatul and interest-1 ing in the telescope. 'Tbis is, however, not the case. In a good instrument the Moon' eh owe tus her wealth of craters, Jupiter his evor-varying- cloud-belts, Mars has snorw-polee and continent-outlines, and Saturn his mm. dorful ring. Yenus, however, shows us just now a lovely half-moon, and that is about all. Patient observers are sometimes rewarded by a glimpse of faint amorphous shadings. I have \u00a3 \u00ab'ii thorn myself more than once with my 8in. reflector, and the late Mr. A. A. Williams, who happened to be observing with me on one such occasion, did the same. But, as a rule, the brilliant crescent presents no detail, and what is eonietimes seen in very small telescopes\u2014two or thfee inches aperture-is usually regarded as fictitious, and with reason. For some time a careful and accurate observer, Mx. M'liarg, of Lisburn, ia Ireland, has been' specially successful in this department, and has published some interesting and remark- able results, which, however, await confirma- tion. The surface of Venue is so cloudy tha/t it is evident we see nothing or next to nothing of its physical details, which is a pity, as Venus is a world nearly as large as our own, and, probably, more earthlike than any other planet, even Mars, as well as being our next-door neighbour.\" Sthe has no satel- lite, but at times of her inferior our earth must shine in her midnight sky with all the splemdoux of a small moon. Venus will be at greateat elongation the end of this month, and at greatest brilliancy the end of Ma.y. At present her northerly deolina,tion is so great that it is nearly midnight before she extinguishes' her bright lamp beneath the horizon..",

Not one woman in ten can hold her dress so that it hangs prettily round the DISASTER AT SEA. The loss ha.s been ascertained of the schooner H. E., of Llanelly, which left that port on February 2, coal laden, for Faversham. She must have foundered off the coast, and her crew six in number, were drowned. The bodv of the captain wsa washed ashore at Pondine, on FONE' MONTH FOK A KISS.\u2014George Youd, of Manchester, has paid dearly for a kiss. He met & girl on Ardwick-green and forcibly kissed her. He coolly told the Stipendiary that he was attracted to the girl by the way sh.e was dressed her hat, he said, especially took his fancy. He was sent to gaol'for a month. An average waltz takes a. dancer over about three-quarters of a mile a square dance makes him cover half a mile.

THE BRITISH CAMPAIGN IN WEST AFRICA \u2014Earl Spencer, on arriving at Paddington 011 Friday from Windsor was met by a messenger with important dispatches, which it is believed have arrived from Bathurst, Senegambia. His lordship at once proceeded to the Admiralty. \u2014The Press Association learns from official sources that 300 men of the West India Regi- ment from Sierra. Leone landed <1t Bathurst on Thursday evening, and advanced against Fodr Silah on Friday. At the same time Admiral Bedford landed a much larger force. A SPLENDID GIFT.\u2014Sir Heory Thompson, the eminent surgeon, has, the\" Observatory Magazine\" states, offered the sum of \"\u00a35,000 sterling to the nation, through the Astronomer Royal, for the purpose of buying a telescope for Greenwich Observatory. It is not often astronomy finds such a generous patron, on this side of the Atlantic at least, and moreover, one who can so well appreciate the exact needs of the science at the moment. For Sir H. Thompson, foreseeing that the astronomy of the future is to be photographic, and feeling that England should be well equipped in this arm, makes it a condition of his gift th&t I the telescope is to be expressly designed for photo- graphic purposes. So far as the plans are made, and subject to the acceptance of the offer by the Government, the instrument is to be of 26in. aperture, just twice that of the telescopes used for the Photographic Chart of the Heavens\u2014in fact, the instrumeut is to be made from the model of the Astrographic Equatorial, but ofexaotty double the dimensions in every particular. The guiding telescope for the new instrument will be 12jin. Merz refractor with a light tube; and the 9in. photographic objective presented by Sir H. ihompson to the Royal Observatory some years ago will also be carried on the same mounting, for u,e as a photoheliograph, as at present. The wen instrument, when completed, will be housed under the Lassel Dome, on the top of the central octagon of the new Physical Observatory, now being built in the south grounds of the Royal Observatory.",

                "full_text": "STELLAR COLLISIONS. Professor Ledger, whose series of Gresham astronomy lectures on \"Knocks in their Relation to Astronomy have just been com- pleted, in his last discourse pointed out that j the universe, instead of being fixed, is alive I with motion, each star with its attendant I planets hurrying through space. If star were to knock against star, the intense heat and fierce fire generated by the enormous velocity and vast, momentum of the two masses would be such as to pass human conception. It may be that the sun was formed by the collision of I, two stars. The effect of two such bodies at- tracting each other and meeting would be to reduce them to a violently agitated gaseous mass, which would oscillate, first inwards, producing inconceivable heat, and then out- wards again, ultimately assuming the condi- tion of the sun. The general result would be that the two bodies would revolve round their common centre of gravity\u2014that is to say, round each other\u2014creating a double star. Lord Kelvin has calculatea that, if 2.9,000,000 solid globes, each of the mass of the moon, should be scattered over a spherical surface 100 times the radius of the earth's orbit, they would come together and be raised to a temperature of 100,000 degrees. They would oscillate outwards and inwaxds, reaching to a I less distance each timg and ultimately settling down into a sphere. The nebulae we see around us may, Professor Ledger sug- gests, have been produced by the knocking together of two great bodies rather than by the aggregation of many smaller ones. The collision of two huge suns would thus lead to rejuvenescence nnd the formation of new systems. Phenomena indicating that some- thing very much in the nature of a collision had occurred are the outbursts of temporary stars such as those observed by i ycho Brahe in 1572, by Kepler in 1604, and those of 1848 1866, 1876,1885, and 1892\u2014the last being the new star Auriga, which declined through ten magnitudes, or became 100,000 times less bright in two months. The great increase in the light of a comet as it approaches the sun may be due to a tidal disttu-bauce in the bodies forming it, causing them to knock against each other and thus generate heat and light. In the same way, the twinklin of the stars may be caused by the knocks of the molecules of the atmosphere on the other whose undulations carry light to us! The excessively great and the exceedingly small are all interdependent, and the past present, and probable future of nebulous bodies all hinge on the relations they bear to the knocks of the molecules of their gases I while the knocks of immense bodies depend ultimately on the knocks of their con- stituent atom3.

IN no part of our hemisphere could the total eclipse-of the moon have been better observed on Saturday night last than in \u00edSwansoo, yet we fear there were but few, if aliy, local scientific observers of that splendid phenomenon. There are many devoted men of science resident amongst us, buttheirspecialities are metallurgy, mineralogy, and chemistry, and very few extend their researches into the sublime domain of astronomy. With the exception of the veteran scientist, Mr Benjamin Hill, of Clydach, we know of no one in this district who has a well-furnished observatory. Even ] our local learned body, the Royal Institution of South; Wales is wholly unprovided with telescope or spectroscope. The roof of that Institution would form an excellent site for an observatory if such a place could be fitted up, and we feel sure such an adjunct < would redound to the credit of the Council quite as much as the projected Laboratory and much more than the proposed Tennis Court The small party of 1 local observers who witnessed the last transit of Venus 1 from the roof of the Institution will not soon forget the impressive splendour of that sight, which was well r within the range of the unaided eye. From that spot the observer has a very wide and wholly uninterrupted 1 horizon for the most part unobstructed by smoke or i mist and it is to be hoped that ere long the Council 1 will see its way to the erection and furnishing of a 1 compact little observatory on the roof of the Institution. 1 In the absence of such facilities, of course, local observa- tions in astronomy must remain imperfect and unsatis- 1 factory. On Saturday night last, many eyes were 1 directed to the chaste satellite, impatiently awaiting 1 the first appearance of the obscuring shadow.

                "full_text": "ARTISTS AND ARTISANS.-LETTER V. TO THE EDITOR OF THE CAMBRIAN.\" SiR,\u2014I think that we maj\" safely say that the works of Hume, Kant, Turgot, Comlorcet, Buckle, Spencer, Mill and Comte, have been crowned with success, and that human history proceeds according to ascertained laws There is in the Science of History (called Sociology) Lr greater play of awkwa'd pert jrbatiocs than in Astro- u >my. Yet, though human prediction is far more splendidly successful in Astronomy than ever it can be in Sociology, yet we are more than amply consoled by the compensation that the course of Sociological facts is highly amenable to human effort, while the course of Astronomical facts :'s highly unamenable. We cannot lengthen or shorten a day we r yn hasten or lettrd the rise or fall of human institutions, such as Serfdom. Catholicism, Monarchy, Tyranny, Republicanism. Still we do in Socialogy detect hw in spite of perturbation. We d. see the rite of the human intellect through superstitious Theologies to baseless and Fruitless Meta- physics, and thence upward to sound science. We d) see the human intellect constructing the Sciences one after another, bringing them to the positive stage in the order of decreasing generality and increasing complexity first Mathematics, the science of number and extension then astronomy, concerning the Heavenly bodies then Physics, concerning the forces at the earth's surface, altering the states of materials; then Chemistry, dealing only with such changes in the state of matter rs alter the nature of bodies then Biology, which deals only with living bodies, or with those chemical combinations and decompositions which are self-sustaining and self- renewing; then Sociology, which deals with the progress of the great united, continous. self-recording organism, formed by the stream of human generat'ons through ages and ages. We do see the natural succession in Action as well as in thought, namely, the fact that human society goes naturally through the stages of offensive warfare and defensive warfare to Industrialism. We do see that there is a law of evolution of feeling correspond- ing to the laws of intellect and action, namely, that family-feeling under Fetichism broadens into civic feel- ing, under Polytheism, and thence into general bene- volence, uuder Monotheism. We can understand the use of Slavery as following and improving upon the slaughter of captives, its development into serfdom, which develops into free labour, which again will doubt- less develop more and more into Organised Labour. AV, e can in Sociology prophecy with moderate success, and we can also work with moderate success tows-rds or against the fnlfilmentof such prophecies. We must first consider, then imagine, then act. Practically, we are all anxious for human progi-ess,-that is to say, we want something better, which we can get; but we don't know exactly what it is like, nor bow exactly to make for it. The very case for the Artist! He must have a good ground- ing in science and in the practical experience of a varied and daring life then he has a good notion as to the powers of Reformers. Then his artistic powers must come into use, and he must construct with full imagina- tion of detail, of the turns of events, the crabljdness of things, the humbug of hyprocites and turncoats, the quarrels amongst the best-intentioned, the questions of money, the cold-shoulder of a suspicious ajd often- fooled world, and the untamable strength and valour of confident heroes. The hour must be described the man must be described, and also all the preliminary hours and preliminary men. Artists must describe Utopias not Utopias which men cannot reach, but Utopias which they bl can, and probably will.\u2014Yours, &c., C. G. H.",

Mr. Kingsleyhadanimmenaecongregation to he a r his sermonat the ChapelRoyal, Whitehall, London, on Sun- day afternoon, the Bishop of London as well as a great many peers and members of the House of Commens being present. The preacher, taking his text from the words in the Epistle to the Hebrews, Yet once more, and I will shake not the earth only, but the heavens,\" declared that the prophecy was being fulfilled once again now, as it was in the first, the fifth, the eleventh, and the sixteenth centuries. All systems of ethic. theology, and science seemed changing, he said. Some talked of .this- as the glorious nineteenth century, the age of progress, the eve of a new reformation, of all sorts of blessings to humanity others spoke of it as the unhappy nineteenth century, the age of scepticism and atheism. Both parties were right and both wrong. God was shaking not the physical world only, but our conceptions of the spiritual world. With increased knowledge had come not increased doubt ('' tha.t,\" said Mr. Kingsley, \"I deny\"), but increased reverence, and the truly irreverent time was the middle ages, with their system-making and their system-mongering, and their cosmogonies framed in the cloister, when the earth was supposed to be a flat plane (the notion of antipodes being unscriptural), heaven above it with the good people in it, and hell below it with the wicked \u2014what could be clearer, since Virgilliaid so? when Tartarus, Styx, and Phlegethon were recognized Christian entities, and Tartarology was as firmly be- lieved in as astronomy now. Astronomy had shaken the theories of the size of the earth, geology those of the age of it. Again, in an age which hated torture reformed criminals, and hesitated, rightly or wrongly: about continuing capital punishment, people asked whether Scripture really endorsed all the middle-age notions of future punishment\u2014whether such phrases as \"outer darkness,\" \"the undying worm,\" \"a Gehenna of fire,\" were to be taken as implying torment hereafter, or as the sure punishment of sin in this life \u2014whether heaven might not be the moral world full of goodness, beneficence, and purity, in which God reigned, and hell a condition of hatred, malice, im- purity. If men were to believe in the same theories of religion as men in mediaeval times believed, when cri- minals were racked, heretics burned alive, and every Mussulman slain by the crusaders was consigned to eternal torture, fearful times were coming for the Church and the people. What, then, remained for us? Surely not an unchangeable cosmogony or ethical system, or dogmatic theology, but an unchangeable King, an unchangeable kingdom. If we believed in that kingdom, surely Christ, the King, who governed it, knew how to govern it better than we did. He it was who was shaking the earth and heaven, changing opinions, burning the cbaff and stubble from about the one foundation of Truth. The Reformation was a change back to apostolic doctrine\u2014might not the new Reformation be still more so?",

We select the following interesting passages from the 43d volume of Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia a well-written trea- tise on astronomy, by Sir J. Herschel:\u2014 Is TIlE lVIOON INHABITED?\u2014Telescopes must yet be greatly improved, before we can expect to see signs of inhabitants, as manifested by edifices or by changes on the surface of the soil. It should, however, be observed, that, owing to the small density of the materials of the moon, and the comparatively feeble gra- vitation of bodies on her surface, muscular force would there go six times as far in overcoming the weight of materials as on the earth. Owing to the want of air, however, it seems impossible that any form of life analogous to those on earth can subsist there. No appearance indicating vegetation, or the slightest variation of surface which can fairly be ascribed to change of season, can any where be discerned. THE FrxED STARS. -Now, for what are we to suppose such magnificent bodies scattered through the abyss of space ? Surely not to illuminate our nights, which an additional moon of the thousandth part of the size of our own would do much better, nor to sparkle as a pageant void of meaning and reality,'and bewilder us among vain conjectures. Useful, it is true,' they are to man as points of exact and permanent reference but he must have studied astronomy to little purpose, who can suppose man to be the only object of his Creator's care, or who does not see in the vast and wonderful apparatus arround us provision for other races of animated beings. The planets, as we have seen, derive their light from the sun but that cannot be the case with the stars. These doubtless, then, are themselves suns, and may, perhaps each in its sphere, be the presiding centre round which other planets, or bodies of which we can form no conception from any analogy offered by our own system, may be circu- lating. SATURN'S RINGs.-The rings of Saturn must present a magni- ficent spectacle from those regions of the planet which lie above their enlightened sides, as vast arches spanning the sky from horizon to horizon, and holding an invariable situation among the stars. On the. other hand, in the regions beneath the dark side, a solar eclipse of fifteen years in duration, under their sha- dow, must afford (to our ideas) an inhospitable asylum to ani- mated beings, ill compensated by the faint light of the satellites. But we shall do wrong to judge of the fitness or unfitness of their condition from what we have seen around us, when, perhaps the very combinations which convey to our minds only image's of horror, may be in reality theatres of the most striking and glori- ous displays of beneficent contrivance.",

                "full_text": "PROFESSOR PRITCHARD DEAD. The Rev. Charles Pritchard, D.D., F.R.S., the Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, died at his house in Oxford on Sunday morning. In spite of serious illness of long duration he paid his visits to the Observatory almost to the last, and it is not long since his astronomical work obtained the highest pos- sible recognition. Dr. Pritchard was a Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge, where he took his degree as 4th Wrangler in 1830. For many years he was headmaster of the Clapham Grammar School, and various men of distinction-the Dean of Westminster and others-owed to him their early training. In 1870 he was elected to the Savilian chair of astronomy at Oxford, and from that date he superintended with unflagging zeal the new Observatory in the Parks, which, through his enthusiasm and thanks to the munificence of Dr. De la Rue, has had an ample share of the endowment of scientific research by the University of late years. Dr. Pritchard was made a Fellow of New College in 1883, and hon. Fellow of St. John's, Cambridge, in 1886. He was President of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1866, and in the same year he was awarded the gold medal of that society for recent valuable discoveries in stellar photometry. He was Hulsean lecturer in 1867, and was select preacher both at Oxford and Cambridge and five times he preached by request before the British Association at their annual meeting. Many treatises from Dr. Pritchard's hands have appeared in the Transactions\" of the Royal Astronomical Society. Among these may be mentioned \"A Treatise on Statical Couples,\" \"The Figure of the Earth,\" The Conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn,\" and a paper on \"An Improved Method of using Mercury for Astronomical Purposes.\" He was the author of one of the most interesting articles in the Bible Dic- tionary \"\u2014namely, The Star of the Magi\" and several articles in the 9th (or last) edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica\" were written by him. In 1886 he was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society for his Uranometria Nova Oxoniensis.\" Many of his writings have been col- lected into a volume entitled Occasional Thoughts of an Astronomer on Nature and Revelation\" (1890). He did not forget in the midst of his Uni- versity life the time which he had spent at Clapham, for in 1886 the Old Boys of that school invited their old schoolmaster to dinner, and the result was a little volume, called Annals of our School Life,\" addressed to his former pupils. Professor Pritchard was in his 84th year at the time of his death. In spite of his great age he was in full possession of all his faculties to the last.",

I The formal opening of the Cardiff City Observatory on Penvlan Hill took place on Saturday, the ceremony being performed by the Lord Mayor. The observatory has been erected within the grounds of the city water works, and. though unpretentious, it is well built, and the most scrupulous care has been taken with the foundations. It is on the Berthon model, with revolving dome and shutters, whilst the telescope itself, the gilt of the late Mr Franklen G. Evans, F.R. A S., to the city, is of massive proportions, and the largest instrument of the kind in the Princi- pality. It, has been mounted on an equatorial stand, and furnished with a driving clock. A large company, consisting of several mem- bers of the City Council and of the Astro- nomic*! Society of Wales, had gathered in the observatory grounds when Councillor Kidd, the chairman of the Telescope Com- mittee, asked the Lord Mayor to formally open* the observatory., He first of all warmly congratulated the Lord Mayor upon his recovery ,and pointed out that this opening ceremony would have been performed long ago bad it not been for the Lord Mayor's unfortunate illness. Councillor Kidd then pro- ceeded to explain the circumstances under which the telescope had been presented to the city, and on behalf of the Telescope Committee he warmly thanked tha members of the family of the late Mr Franklen Evans, the donor, for the great interest they had taken in the matter. Mr Franklen Evans's idea when he gave this instrument was to hw!n those thousands of people who had made astcdy of astronomy and who had not the wherewithal to look through a large instrument, and to see the heavenly bodies as they ought to be seen. He had also to thank the members of the Astronomical Society of Wales for the great interest theV had taken in the matter, and Mr Arthur Mee, Mr Atkinson, and Mr A. Taylor for the vror-k they had put in in putting the instrument in order. (Hear, hear.) The Lord Mayor, iu formally declaring the observatory open, said that at one time the members of tbe Corporation did] not realise the importance of the telescope to a large maritime centre like Cardiff. From an educational point of view it should prove invaluable to students. and he sincerely hoped his fellow citizens and his fellow countrymen would come to the observatory, which would be always open, under certain conditions to improve their knowledge of the heavens: (Applause.) Car- diff was again to the fore, and was the only municipality in Wales that could give its citi- zens this opportunity. &n(j this was quite in keeping with its being the leading town in the Principality. He sincerely hoped the instru- ment would he well used by those who took an interest in astronomy. (Hear, hear.) Mr A. Tayior, F.R..A-S.. then delivered a short address on the value of the telescope as a powerful educational factor and invaluable to students and teachers. Major-General H. H. Lee proposed a vote of thanks to Mr Taylor, and a similar compliment was paid to the Lord Mayor, after which tbe company were entertained to tea.",

                "full_text": "COMMON SENSE\" ON ASTRONOMY. The author of a book called \"Common Sense\" is a superlative joker, and his friend Parallax (whoever he may be) belongs, no doubt, to the same facetious school of philosophers. The author of this very amusing and not altogether uninetractive essay endea- vours to laugh us out of all that modern science has taught us on the subject of astronomy. The alleged discoveries of Copernious and Newton- Pure intelligence, whom God To mortals lent to trace his boundless works, Through laws sublimely simple-\" are no discoveries at all. They are mere assumptions and idle theories; in fact, the Newtonian system is an execrable superstition.\" Onr author boldly contends that the earth is not a globe, and that there are no antipodes. He maintains that the earth is an extended level surface, on every hand raised above the one grand level of seas and oceans;\" a horizontal plane; that it is immoveable; that if it travelled at the speed assigned to it by modern astronomers, everything it -and b.a ,aonfid<yitly appeals to the as to the fixity of the earth (which he denies to be a planet) and the motions of the heavenly bodies in con. firmation of his assertion. He treats with supreme contempt and denounces in the strongest-were he not joking, we would say the most offensive\u2014epithets, modern astronomers and their theories- Those earthly godfathers of heaven's lights That give a name to every fixed star, Have no more profit of their shining nights Than those that walk and wot not what they are.\" Indeed, he affirms, with confidence, that the notions of the rustic vulgar before the Copernicau system waa developed are true, and those of the philosophers false. With the exception of the assertion that the earth is a plane or level surface (the inequalities of hills and mountains being inappreciable in comparison to the vast size of the body), the author's philosophy is- purely negative. He does not attempt to construct any system which will afford an explanation of the phenomena we perceive; his purpose is simply de- structive. He endeavours to overturn the arguments advanced by eminent writers to prove the globular form of the earth, and in some casea he is excessively happy in the manner in which he takes advantage of unguarded expressions and amphibolia. He is always amusing and playful, but nothing can be more mirth- moving than the affected solemnity with which he puts himself forward as the advocate of truth\u2014even though he should be a martyr \u2014 in opposition to all the astronomical theorists. Throughout the work the author displays abundant evidenoe of deep thought and a nicely discerning mind, but his love of fun and irony never forsakes him. He banters, ridicules, jeers, scoffs, and chaffs the philosophers in a manner that would be merciless if it were not so humorous; and what puzzles us, is that some of his reviewers should have attempted to treat him seriously. As a specimen of the author's pleasant logic, let the following suffice. Dr. Mann, in an argument to prove the convexity of the earth, says, that mankind having invented ships, went \"to sail in theni on the sea.. They then went further and farther, until at last they found they could again reach the spot they started from without turning back at all.\" To this our author replies, \"Here we find that the ship went further and further, and got back again, nevertheless; and that, although they got back again, it was without turning back at all. So they came back, then, or returned.\" It is not likely, notwithstanding the challenge thrown out in the preface, that any of the \"theoretical astronomers,\" to use the author's phrase, will seriously vouchsafe an answer to a work written in this pleasant vein.",

That cheap printing is not beneficial to the community,\" which took place on Friday last, was the flattest listened to for many a long day. Mr C. J. Hughes, B.A., took the affirmative of the proposition as it stands, and Mr William Williams the negative. The speeches of the openers showed that they had given little thought to the subject and they expressed what they had to say in a weak manner, their speeches occupying together about ten minutes. The other speakers were:\u2014On the affirmative, Miss Scott and Mr David Williams; and on the negative, Mr Dew- hurst, Mr Seex, Mr E. Lima Jones, the President, Mr Tom Davies, Mr Occie Davies, Mr Lee Davies, and Miss Olive Jones. As was naturally to be expected after the feeble opening speeches, all the various speakers showed up poorly. The debate lacked the enthusiasm which generally charac- terises the proceedings of this Society. READING ROOM.\u2014 Verily it is no wonder that the Reading Room does not pay its way. It is every evening filled with a crowd of rowdy boys, whose conduct at their games of draughts and chess is hardly conformable to the rules which one might expect to find adhere4 to at a reading room as such. For several days recently several of the papers, notably the \"South Wales Daily News,\" have been removed from the table by somebody. COUNTY SCHOOL.\u2014This week the number of pupils has gone up higher again. The entertain- ment arranged by Miss Scott and Mr Williams for the benefit of the library funds will come off this day fortnight. It will consist of three parts:\u2014 Christy Minstrels, Mrs Jarley's waxworks, and a laughable farce entitled, My Turn Next.\" The entertainment will thus provide a great variety of good things, each section being of an^exceptionally taking character. About twenty of the school- boys will form the troupe of Christy Minstrels. BRITISH SCHOOL.\u2014Miss Gretta Rees has passed her third year's pupil-teachership examinations, obtaining the mark \"well.\" Miss Elizabeth Davies, Gwalia House, also another of the staff has com- pleted her first year creditably. THE TOWN LIGHTS.\u2014The authorities of Aber- ayron are nothing if they are not promoters of education, and that of the highest type, especially scientific and technical education. The truth oi this statement may not be apparent at first, but if one looks into the root, into the cause as it were, of various curious customs prevailing in our town, one has to admit the truth of this assertion. For instance, upon first aquaintance with the town, the stranger cannot understand, and, therefore, as usual in such cases, misunderstands, why it is that in the case of the town-lights, the lamps should be all lit when the moon is at its full, but that when the moon is wholly hidden there should be no lighting of the lamps at all. But the truth has suddenly flashed out, even as an inspiration comes at times. The new theory is this :\u2014The lamps are lit when the moon waxeth strong so that we may have light whereby we may carefully study the, moon, and the starry firmament on high, thus promoting the use- ful and instructive study of astronomy. Again when the moon is not seen, what is the need for lamps? For the proper study of astronomy and lunonomy one must be able to see the objects studied. Also a perfectly dark night is conductive to the making of poets, and to the forming of the heroij strain in men. Who, after these, explana- tions of one of the misunderstood\u2014and this is only one-actions of our town authorities, will say that they\u2014the authorities, not the actions-are not actuated by the highest regard for the public welfare and progress ?",

                "full_text": "\"OQMJJfON SENSE\" ON ASTRONOMY. The autior of a book called Common Sense\" is a superlative joker, and his friend Parallax (whoever he may be) belongs, no doubt, to the same facetious school of philosojhers. The author of this very amusing and not altogether uninttructive essay endaa* vours to laugh us out of all that modern science has taught us oa the subject of astronomy. The alleged discoveries of Copernicus and Newton- Pureintelligence, whom God To mortals lent to trace his boundless works, Through laws sublimely simple\u2014\" are no discoveries at all. They are mere assumptions and idle theories in fact, the Newtonian system is an execrable superstition.\" Our'author boldly contends that the earth is not a globe, and that there are no antipodes. He maintains that the earth is an extanded \"level surface, on every hand raised above the one grand level of seas and oceans;\" a horizontal plane: that it is immoveable; that if it travelled at the speed. assigned to it by modern astronomers, everything would fall off it; and he confidently appeals to tie testimony of the visual organs of mankind in all ages as to the fixity of the earth (which he denies to be a planet) and the motions of the heavenly bodies in con- firmation of his assertion. He treats with supreme oontempt and denounces in the fabrongest-were he not joking, we would say the most offensive-opithate, modern astronomers and their theories Those earthly godfathers of heaven's lights That give a name to every fixed stnr, Have no more profit, of their shining iiightg Than those that walk and wot not what fclioy are. Indeed, he affirms, with confidence, that tl r>ntioz& of the rustic vulgar before the Copernioaia system wat* developed are true, and those of the philosophers false. With the exception of the assertion that the earth is a plane or level surface (the inequalities of hills v and mountains being inappreciable in compariaon to the vast ize of the body), the author's philosophy is purely negative. He does not attempt to construct any system which will afford an explanation of the phenomena we perceive; his purpose is simply de- structive. He endeavours to overturn tie arguments advanced by eminent writers to prove the globular form of the earth, and in some cases he is excessively happy in the manner in.whia he take3 advantage of unguarded expressions end amphibolis. He is always amusing and playful, but nothing can be more mirth- paoving than the affeQtei solemnity with which he puts himself forward as the advocate of trlltb-evan though he should be a martyr in opposition to all the asibronomidil theorists. Throughout the work the author llays abundant evidence of deep thought and a nioey discerning mind, but hie- love of fun and irony neve- forsakes him. He banters, ridicules, jeers, scoffs, endchaffs the philosophers in a manner that would be neroiless if it were not so humorous; and what puzzes us, is that some of his reviewers shouia have attempted to treat him seriously. As a specimen of the autlor's pleasant logic, let the following suffice. Dr. Mani, in an argument to prove the convexity of the earth, tijs, that mankind having invented ships, went \"to ail in them on the sea. They then went further and?brther, until at last they fpund they could again reach he spot they started from without turning back at all\" To this our author Replies, \"Here we find that tie ship went further and further, and got back again, levertheless; and that, although they got back again,it was without turning back at all. So ttey came back, then, or returned.\" It is not likely, notwithstanding the challenge thrown out in the pieface, that any of the theoretical astronomers,' to use the author's phrase, will seriously vouchsafe an answer to. a work written in this pleasant vein.",

                "full_text": "IMPORTANT DISCOVERY BY MOIUEN.\" TO THK KDITOlt OF THE WKSTHHN MAIL SIB,\u2014The learned world lias long suspected that the Twelve Battles of King Arthur mean, like tlto Twelve Labours of Hercuie. the sun passing through the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac, nnd that, therefore, \"Arthur\" was cno of thll titles of the sun in Cambro-British Druidism. We know that the Great Bear (Ursa Major) is known in the Welsh language ns Arthur's lllougli (Aradr Arthur). The lyra is called Arthur's limp iteivit Arthur). Many an old circle of stones in Wales and elsewhere is called Arthur's Quoit (Coiten Arthur). The last name has greatly puzzled antiquarians. Now, the names Araar Arthur (Arthur's Plougii-Ursa ftiajor\u2014Great Hear) and Arthur's n'lrp (the Lyre) on astronomical signs would themselves indicate some strange connection of \"Arthur\" with astronomy. We know that the cirole of twelve stones of the Goreedd of tho Hards (Exalted Throue of the liards) signi- lies the circle of the Zodiac, with its twelve signs around the globe, and, therefore, that the Cromlech, and uiso the Logan Stone -sometimes it is the one and sometimes the other which is found in the centre of the circle-dignifies the globe of the earth. The Hocking Stone (Logan Stone) and the top slab ot the C'roinlecn both signify the earth as the repository, throuh the winter months, of the seed germs amun? the general deu%y. As cGnsequence, this repository i. lt\u00ebm.1>l'utdbm An:h yr H?ut (Ark of the Sun), hence the old creed u?)ned\"H?t)o-Atkito.\" It seems that the Gorsedd was named by the ell- lightened old Druids Coiten .<1rlhur\" (Arthur's Quoit) to imply the insignificance ot the srlllbul iu comparison 10 what it .symbolised, viz.. the sun's apparent circle around the earth and the globe itself. 1 now come to what I think is a most startling and important di^coveiy. ^'ennius, in his Ilistorv of tho Britons, p. 403 (Bohn'sed.), states thatKin? Arthur in his t/?/t wale with the &xuus bore on his 8hiel\u00f9-pwyd (shield), and not ysjtt?y(ta (shoulder), as Utu Rev. Thomas rriw ?\"CdL-i..? lm.iQawe\" ) pj>iuls OUl,! think conclusively\u2014'bore oil liia shield the Image of thu Holy Virgin, Mother of God.\" Let the reader observe closely that ilieuioiik Netinius asserts it was Arthur's eit/htlt battle. Let, the reader tiirti to any work Oil astronomy and he will lind that, by counting In the right of the Zodiac, the eii/hlli sijiu is Viryo (Vitfin): \u2014 (X; Aries, (2) Fisce?, (3) Aquarius, (4) Callrlcuruu, (5), Sagittarius, (6) Scorpio. (7; Libra, (8; Virgo. Geolirey of Monmouth, in his\" British History,\" tells us (p. 234) that the name of Arthur's shield was\" Priwen (1'rydwen), or Britantiiu. It is deeply interesting thus to find the Holy Virln Mary and Britannia, the goddess of til* West, mistaken one for the Llier by L)??til Neeinius aud GeolTrey of Alonmouth. It illustrates the confusion which exiswd in tha British Isles in early times, as the result of Christianity and Bardisiu in conflict with each other. In those times the monks evidently mistook the Druidic allegories describing the sun's twelve labours against Avagddu and Annhrus.or tiiePowerof Dark- ness. for \"twelve battles\" against the Saxons Who will now deny that we have been cheated by these monks \"all along tho line\" ? Another point well worth observing is that it was in September, which is the mouth of thlf sign Virgo of tho Zodiac (month Tisri of the Hebrews), that the Feast of Atonement took place, and that the high priest entered into the Holy of Holie, where was tile ark of tlie covenant, and where l he Divine pre- sence rested on it in tho cloud upon tlio mercy IBeLLt.-I arn, &'C..

                "full_text": "SOME OF THE MAGAZINES. We have received the first number of Sir Robert Ball's Story of the Heaven3,\" a magnificent work, published in fourteen monthly parts by Messrs Cassell and Company. Sir Robert Ball is the Lowndoan Professor of Astronomy, Cambridge, but he is better known to the average person as a very interesting lecturer in connection with the Gilchrist trust. The Story of the Heavens is accompanied by very valuable plates, and in the early chapters Sir Robert, describing how much the beginner in astronomy may observe for himself, says Let us suppose that the observer is provided with an opera- glitss and is about to commence his astronomical studies. The first step is to become acquainted with the conspicuous group of seven stars called the Plough, or Charles's Wain, but astronomers prefer to regard it as a portion of the constellation of the Great Bear (Ursa Major). There are many features of interest in this constellation, and the beginner should learn as soon as possible to identify the seven stars which compose it. Of thjse the two at the head of the Bear are generally cailed the pointers.\" They are of sptcial use, because ,hey serve to guide the eye to that most important star in the whole sky, known as the pole star.\" Fix the attention on that region in the Great Bear which forms a sort of rectangle. The next fine night try to count how many stars are visible withiu that rectangle. On a very line night, without a moon, perhaps a dozen might bt perceived, or even more, according to the keeness of the eye- Dut. when the OpCLa.lcb3\u00bb la ILITOCTCIL to the same part of the constellation an astonishing s;ht is witnessed. A hundred stars can now be seen with the greatest ease. But the opera-glass will not show nearly all the stars in this region. Any good telescope will reveal many hundreds too faint for the feebler instrument. The greater the telescope the more numerous the stars so that seen through one of the colossal instruments the number would have to be reckoned in thousands. We have chosen the Great Bear because it is more generally known than any other constellation. But the Great Bear is not exceptionally rich in stare. To tell the number of the stars is a task which no man has accomplished but various estimates have been made. Our great telescopes can probably show at least 50,000,000 stars.\" Cassell'a Mayazinc for this month is set off with a very interesting cover picture, entitled, When Jack comes Home,\" wherein Jack is depicted with his wife, and carrying his little daughter along the atteet. There is a very instructive article on The building of a great telescope,\" founded by Mr Charles T. Yerkes, at William's Biy, Wisconsin, U S.A. Some idea of the siza and tremendous magnifying power of this enormous instrument may bo gathered when it is stated thaz it is twenty-four yards long, and weighs, with its iron pedestal and masonry, seventy-tive tous, and was built at a coat of iE250,000 Still more interesting perhaps is the article, entitled Town a.nd Gown Rows at Oxford.\" AU who have read history must know of the street fights between 'I the undorgrK-dukd and the townsmen.

The fight led to a riot on the part of the negroes, which was only quelled with some difficulty. Two days later a posse of troops sought to arrest the murderer, and the negroes on their part endeavoured to protect him. A fusillade was opened on both sides and continued for some time, the blacks finally being driven off. Four of the negroes are known to be killed, 15 are wounded, and a large number have been arrested. The negroes throughout the whole district are reported to be organising, and the governor of the State has consequently ordered reinforcements to the district.

                "full_text": "A SERMON AT THE CHAPEL ROYAL. Mr. Kingsley had an immense congregation to hen his sermon at the Chapel Royal, Whitehall, London, on Sun- day afternoon, the Bishop of London as well as a great many peers and members of the House of Commons being present. The preacher, taking his text from the words in the Epistle to the Hebrews, \"Yet once more, and I will shake not the earth only, but the heavens,\" declared that the prophecy was being fulfilled once again now, as it was in the first, the fifth, the eleventh, and the sixteenth centuries. All systems of ethic- theology, and science seemed changing, he said. Some talked of this as the glorious nineteenth century, the age of progress, the eve of a new reformation, of all sorts of blessings to humanity others spoke of it as the unhappy nineteenth century, the age of scepticism and atheism. Both parties were right and both wrong. God was shaking not the physical world only, but our conceptions of the spiritual world. With increased knowledge had come not increased doubt ( that,\" said Mr. Kingsley, \"I deny\"), but increased reverence, and the truly irreverent time was the middle ages, with their system-making and their system-mongering, and their cosmogonies framed in the cloister, when the earth was supposed to be a flat plane (the notion of ant podes being unscriptural), heaven ab\"ve it with the good people in it, and hell below it with the wicked \u2014what could be clearer, since Virgil said so ?\u2014when Tartarus, Styx, and Phlegethon were recognized Christian entities, and Tarrarology was as firmly be- lieved in as astronomy now. Astronomy had thaken the theories of the size of the earth, geology those of the age of it. Again, in an age which hated torture, reformed criminals, and hesitated, lightly or wrongly, about continuing capital punishment, people asked whether Scripture really endorsed all the middle-age notions of future punishment- whether such phrases as \"outer darkness,\" \"the undying worm,\" \"a Gehenna of nre,\" were to be taken as implying torment hereaftrr, or as the sure punishment of sin in this life \u2014whether heaven might not be the moral world full of goodness, beneficence, and purity, in which God reigned, and hell a condition of hatred, malice, iin- purity. If men were to believe in the same theories gf religion as men in mediaeval times believed, when cri- minals were racked, heretics burned alive, and every Mussulman slain by the crusaders was consigned to eternal torture, feSrful times were coming for the Church and the people. What, then, remained for us? Surely not an unchangeable cosmogony or ethical system, or dogmatic theology, but an unchangeable King, an unchangeable kingdom. If we believed in that kingdom, sur. ly Christ, the King, who governed it, knew how to govern it better than we did. He it was who was shaking the earth and heaven, changing opinions, burning the chaff and stubble from about the one foundation of Truth. The Reformation was a change back to apostolic doctrine\u2014might not the new Reformation be still more so?",

Lord Hamilton of Dalzell, who will be one of the suite in attendance on the Duke of Connaught at the opening of the first Union Parliament of South Africa, has been to that country before under very different I circumstances, for he served with the Im- perial Yeomanry in the war. Lord Hamilton is thirty-seven years of age and a bachelor. His father was Liberal member for Falkirk Burghs for some years, and on his defeat in 1886 was rewarded for past services with a peerage. Later on he served as a Lord-in- 'I Waiting, as the present holder of the title does also. Both father and son began their careers in the Army. Lord Hamilton has a beautiful seat in Lanarkshire, which i belonged once to the Earls of Carnwath, but passed to the Hamiltons by a marriage in I' the seventeenth century. o: A LABOUR MEMBER. Mr. James Haslam, this year's president of the Trade Union Congress, is member for the Ches- terfield Division of Derbyshire, which he has represented since 1906. He was returned in that year by a substantial majority of 1664, and when he again went to the poll last January his constitu- ents showed their confidence in him by sending him back to I the House of Com- mons with a majority of 2,5H over his Con- servative opponent, I Mr. Haslam was born in 1842, and went to the village school, i He is general secre- tary of the Derby- shire Miners' Association, and -is a magistrate for Derbyshire. He has had experience in local government, having once been a member of the Chesterfield Town Council. He is a member of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union I Congress. -:0: 1 THE NATION'S TIMEKEEPER. Mr. Frank Watson Dyson, F.R.S., now Astro- nomer-Royal of Scotland, has been appointed to succeed Sir William Christie as Astronomer- RoyaL For eleven years before going to Scotland in 1905 Mr. Dyson had been chief assistant at Greenwich, where he now returns. He is the son of a Baptist Minister, and is forty-two years of age. He had a dis- tinguished career at Cambridge, was second Wrangler in 1889, Smith's prize- man, Isaac Newton student, and Fellow of Trinity College. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1901, and has pub- lished n umerous papers on mathematics and astronomy. Mr. Dyson, as Astronomer Royal, becomes re- sponsible for the nation's time. From Greenwich signals are sent all over Great Britain, and this forms an impor- tant part of the daily routine. The observatory also takes its part in mapping the heavens. A photographic record of the sun's face has for some years past been kept, and the Astronomer Royal and his assistants engage in researches into every branch of astronomy.",

                "full_text": "DRUIDISM. To the Editor of the \"Llangollen Advertiser.\" Sir,\u2014Thanks to your correspondent for his full and prompt reply to my questions. Of course, he will understand that I sent the questions more in the interest of your readers, who might be anxious for further information than mine own. I felt in reading J. S. G's. letter that the difficulties of the subject were hardly grappled with. It is evident that he had not consulted the best and latest Oriental and Celtic authorities. There are difficulties which his letter, good as it is, gives rise to. If the system was not pagan, nor Christian, nor a mixture, what was it? Of course, I use the word Christian not in a New Testament, but revelation sense. They had an idea of a supreme god, but was he the personal and spiritual God of revelation ? If so, how was their belief in the revealed God consistent with their idol worship ? In all pagan systems we find the worship of the one in the absence of belief in the other. Again, we learn that astronomy formed a large element in the religious systems and beliefs of the Orientals, How then was its introduction into Druidism consistent with the statement of your correspondent that it was the purest form of primitive religion ?\" We do not find astronomy or astrology forming a part of primitive religion until it came in contact with and was cor- rupted by the religious systems of Egypt, Assyria, and Persia. I have an idea that Druidism was largely moulded by Eastern paganism, tinged perhaps by Grecian and Roman philosophy in its passage from East to West. Again, my third question had no reference to Druidism as an established religion. In using the word \"state\" I did not refer to anything political. If the magisterial and civil power, as well as the religious, was vested in the different Druidical grades or classes, what state was there apart from the Church system ? Your correspondent writes that they sat as magistrates, deciding all questions of law and equity; at the same time they were subject to the civil power.\" What civil power apart from themselves and their ecclesiastical system? They had power to excommunicate, which put the offend- ing party out of the pale of the law excommunicate from what ? The pale of what law, religious or civil Was there any difference between Druidism as a state and ecclesiastical system and the papal system dur- ing the period that the pope was vested with temporal power? Again, if the Cromlechs were Druidical altars, as suggested by your correspondent, what reason can be given for their appearance in Scandinavia and other parts of the continent ? What reason can be given for the predilection of the Druids for the oak when the same tree played such a prominent part in Aryan mythology? Lastly, present Celtic scholars have proved, I think, beyond a doubt, that the original religion of the Celt was a sort of Aryan polytheism. Whence then comes Druidism ? It is Christmas time, so I am not able to devote much time and thought to this intricate subject; yet I did not wish the kind letter of your correspondent to pass by unnoticed, even for a week, Wishing you, your correspondents, and readers a very happy new year, Yours truly, Dec. 31st.

                "full_text": "Amateur Astronomers. I Their Ignorance and Impertinence. I According to a weekly paper, whose representa- tive has interviewed -the Astronomer Royal of Dublin, the amateur astronomer is the greatest trouble that Sir Robert Ball has to contend against. Asked to tell something of queer people and their still queerer ideas of astronomy, Sir Robert said Generally speaking it is quite uneducated folk-in fact, folk who cannot under- stand their own ignorance-who write to me in relation to the discovery of heavenly bodies, and no matter how ridiculous their notions may be, if I tell them that their views and mine do not coincide they very often become abusive. As a rule, they regard it as a conspiracy that is to say, if a man has some preposterous idea of communicating, say, for example, with the sun, and I take the trouble to point out the mistake to him, he immediately becomes possessed with the idea that there is a sort of astronomers' trade union which will have nothing whatever to do with wonderful discoveries. I remember a man once saying that he had succeeded in squaring the circle. He, too, I believe, went away with the notion that I was conspiring against him. TI Signal Mars. I 44 There has been a number of crack-brained projects for communicating with the stars. Here is one which I recall at the momenb. It was a scheme for communicating with Mars, and what the inventor proposed to do was to turn all the gas in London simultaneously up and down\u2014to beat time as it were. Ho imagined we should got a response, of course. I daresay the efifect would be seen in Mars, but what would be the use of it? I am perfectly convinced that man, as we know him, inhabits this planet, and this planet alone. Tliere may be other beings in the heavenly bodies, but there are no human beings. Man is an animal just fitted for this globe.\" How Mars Might be Signalled. I On the question of signalling Mars, Sir Robert Ball thus expressed himself If a flag as large as Ireland, placed at the end of a pole 500 miles long, was waved it would just be visible from Mars. As I have said, we can never hope to make any intelligible signals, but the sentimental star dreamer disagrees with me. \"Some time back a man came forward with the startling intelligence that the propositions of Euclid must be known in every place where, people exist. His idea was to describe colossal triangles by means of lights in the great desert of Sahara and thus transmit the propositions to every region inhabited by human beings. A grocer's assistant once sent me a lengthy epistle, saying that he was completely thrown away in the cheese and rasher of bacon line. My talent and genius,' so ran the letter, 4 show that I am marked out to be an astronomer, Thinking that perhaps there might be something in the gentle- man I read on, but my intelligence received a rude awakening when I read 4 For my mind finds no rest for the sole of her foot save on one of the heavenly bodies.' I really felt compelled to advise my correspondent, not only in his own interest, but also in my own, to stick to the grocery business and give up astronomy.\"",

Un o'r pethau mwyaf dyrus yn y Beibl yw xhifnod- au, megys nifer plant Israel pan yn myned i waered o'r Aim Rhoddir ar ddeall i ni yn 1 Samuel 6:19, i'r Arglwydd daraw 50,070 o wyr Bethaemes am edryoh i mewn i'r arch, ao eto ymddengys nad oedd Bethsemes ond pentref byohan. Yn Barnwyr 12:6, dywedir: \"A ohwympddd y pryd hwnw o Ephraim 42,000 o wyr,\" tra nad oedd y llwyth yohyd- ig baoh yn flaenoxol yn oynwys ond 32,5C3. Diofalwoh y oyfieithwyr yw hyn oil. Oeir eglurhad ar hyn yn Llawlyfr y Beibl gan Dr. Augus, tudalen 39; 1,170 darawyd o wyr Bethsemes, a 2,040 a gwympodd o Ephraim. Tybed mai i'r Beibl yn unig y perthyn an- hawsder rhifyddol; nage, y mae i'w weled yn fil amlyoaoh, ao yn anmhosibl i mi ei gysoni, mewn llyfrau a ysgrifenwyd yn yr oes oleuedig hon; ie, mewn llyfrau na all y bai fod wxth y oyfieithwyx.

The rev. gentleman, who is an eminent mathematician, received his theological training at Airedale College, Bradford, and was for 14 years pastor of the Congregational Church at Brighouse, York- shire, and also occupied the chairs of mathe- matics and logic in the college where he had been trained for the ministry. He was after- wards elected pastor of an important Congrega- tional church at Leicester, and became president of the Literary and Philosophical Society, there, besides devoting much of his time to pubhc work and with the various movements for the social and intellectual improvement of the people. He was elected a member of the first School Board at Leicester, and of the Executive Com- mittee of the National Education League. In 872 he was appointed vice-principal of Mill-hill ? T, \u201een years later he became principal u l j^ ld College. Iri 1886 he took charge of the leading Congregational church at Oxford, a position which he resigned in order to devote himself to scientific research. He is one of the very few Nonconformist ministers who have been admitted to the Royal Society, and lie is also a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. He is the author of numerous papers, chiefly on questions on pure mathematics or symbolic logic, and has made several important discoveries in connection with this science, and in consequence of his well-known abilities has been associated with the foremost scientists of the day. He has also been long recognised as an eloquent preacher. His discourse on Sunday evening was based on the 19th Psalm, the 1st, 2nd, and 7th verses\u2014 \"The heavens declare the glory of God.\" He first dwelt on some points of contrast in reference to the Word and works of God, showing how the teachings of the one need to be supplemented and interpreted by the teachings of the other. Both were divine revelations, and necessary to man's intellectual and moral culture. The study of the stars was sublime. It served to expand their intellect and lift their thoughts to God; but the Bible was a revelation entirely adapted to man's moral necessities. The external vast- ness and magnificence of the science of astronomy served to make it one of the most sublime and fascinating of all the natural sciences. It was God's revelation of Him- self in external nature; but He had given them another revelation in;the.Gospel. They could do without astronomy, but not without salvation. They could do without the natural sciences, but not without the knowledge of Christ. All know- ledge was valuable, but this was invaluable. \"Therefore,\" he added, \"let not the philosopher glory in his philosophy let not the wise man glory in his wisdom but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth God.\"",

I really felt compelled to advise my correspondent, not only in his own interest, but also in my own, to stick to the grocery business and give up astronomy.\"",

                "full_text": "THE ASTRONOMY OF THE A-NCIENTS.-Frofessor Mitchell, in his lectures on astronomy, related a very remarkable fact. He said he had not long since met in the city of St. Louis, Missouri, a man of great scientific attainments, who for 40 years had been engaged in Egypt deciphering the hieroglyphics of the ancients. This gentleman had stated to him that he had lately unravelled the inscriptions upon the coffin of a mummy, now in the British Museum, and that by the aid of previous observation he had dis- coverea me Key to an tne astronomical knowledge of the Egyptians. The zodiac, with the exact positions of the planets, was delineated on the coffin, and the date to which they pointed was the autumnal equinox in the year 1722 before Christ, or nearly 3,500 years ago. Professor Mitchell employed his assistants to ascertain the exact position of the heavenly bodies belonging to our solar system on the equinox of that year (1722 B.C.), and send him a correct diagram of them, without having communicated his object in so doing. In compliance with this the calculations were made, and to his astonishment, on comparing the result with the statements of his scientific friend already referred to, it was found that, on the 7th of October, 1722, B.C., the moon and planets had occupied the exact positions in the heavens marked upon the coffin in the British M useum. TRICKS OF TRADE.\u2014To disparage a good article for the purpose of selling all inferior, or a bad one, is not an un- usual practice with a certain class of tjaders. This highly censurable course, according to the statements of medical men and thier suffering patients, has been pursued-it is hoped with little advantage-by some apparently respectab le but not over-scrupulous chemist, and druggists towards that invaluable remedy, Dr. de Jongh's Light-Brown Cod Liver Oil, in lieu of which an inferior Pale, Yellow or Coarse Brown, so called, Cod Liver Oil-either passively inert and useless, or positively and actively perniciouis-is often secretly substituted or intrusively recommended by these parties. This exceptionable conduct proceeds from too obvious motives of cupidity to need explanation but its exposure is requisite, as well to guard purchasers against decept;on, injury, or disappointment, as to maintain the reputation of a remedial and salutary agent of estimable value. The rewards bestowed upon Dr. de Jongh by con tinental Governments and learned societies, the spontaneous encomiums passed upon his researches by the most illus- trious scientific men, the patronage which his celebrated Oil has received at the hands of she elite of the Faculty at home and abroad, have obtained for his preparation too high a public appreciation to be easily affected by the mercenary machinations of some avaricious dealers, not satisfied with the legitimate profits of trade.",

It had seen empires and kings dis- appear and vanish in the shadows of the past: and whatever happened in the future he trusted that\u2014 they would believe him to be sincere in what he said \u2014nothing would happen that would damage the influ- ence of that greatest and grandest religious institu- tion in the world (hear, hear, and loud cheers). How- ever, it was hardly necessary for him to praise the Church of England in Welshpool. He begged to thank them for the manner in which they had re- ceived the toast of ministers of other denominations -(hear, hear)-the weaker brethren (lausrhter and applause). Those who, as a rule, were of slow speech and stammering tongue. Those who, as a rule, were like the farmer's cow, grazinsr on the top of the hill\u2014they had a poor pasture, but a fine pros- pect (loud laughter). However, he thanked them for the manner in which they had received the toast. He knew very well that some of them were of opinion that they poor Dissenting preachers took no interest in the social life of the nation (\" No, no.\"). They said those ministers promised them splendid things in another world, but they wanted to make people long-faced and miserable in this world. If such had been the case in the past, he was glad to say that it was not so in the present. It was the duty of every minister of the Gospel to look after the physical and social wants of the people, of course not forgetting their spiritual wel- fare. The Gospel was all very well in its place, but it would not satisfy an empty stomach. They had read of the gentleman who was crossing the ferry. He said to the boatman, \"Do you understand Geography?\" The boatman replied \"No, indeed.\" The gentleman said What a pity there's a quarter of your life lost.\" The gentleman then asked \"Do you know anything about Astronomy :j\" The poor boatman knew nothing about that either, and the gentleman exclaimed Then there's half of your life gone. \"Do you understand Geology?\" was the next question, and the boatman signified his ignorance of that science too. The gentleman gravely said \"Then there's three-fourths of your life lost.\" By-and-by over went the boat, and the boatman asked \"Can you swim?\" \"No,\" answered the gentleman. \"Well,\" said the boatman, \"there's the whole of your life gone.\" (Laughter.) They knew that Geology and Astronomy were very well in their places, but when the boat was upset the one thing needful was the power to swim: and he trusted they would not forget the more important and the minor duties of life. They as members of that Society were preparing for a rainy day; they believed in the glorious privilege of being independent. He again thanked them for the hearty manner in which they had received the toast. He hoped the day was not far distant when all those religious differences would disappear; when one would say to another\" I am as thou art: I am for making all men greater, nobler, and happier; give me thy hand.\" (Loud cheers.)",

                "full_text": "SIR ROBERT BALL AT NEWPORT. The great astronomical authority was the central figure at the opening of the session of the Newport Literary Society at the Tredegar Hall, Newport, last evening. The subject of his address was the suggestive one of Other Worlds than Ours.\" The hall was crowded. Lord Tre- degar presided, and was, as usual, an adroit chairman. There was no subject, he said, that tho general public knew so little about as astronomy. No one from the floor to the roof of that building, but all some period of his childhood had repeated the two lines, Twinkle, twinkle, little star; how I wonder what you are. (Laughter.) That, he believed, ended the search- ings of astronomy of the greater portion of the audience. (Hear, hear.) He would leave Sir: Robert Ball to explain what thoso lines meant.\u2014 Sir Robert at once plunged into his subject. The' great Lick Observatory on Mounb Hamilton and the large telescope at Melbourne were referred-to as the best of the world's appliances to find out what the other worlds were like. As there were a hundred million stars, ib was necessary to make a selection. Venus and Mars, the two nearest neighbours to the earth, were then dealt with on the happy suggestion that people generally knew more about their neighbours' affairs than the neighbours did themselves. The phases of Venus, the iacb as discovered by the last transit, that' Venus has a robe of air surrounding it; its continents and arctic .iZiovvs were dealt with, and the suggestion offered that there was life on the planet, probably of a most luxuriant character. Venu was noli favourably situated for observation because when it waa nearest its light waR obsoured; notso Mars, who showed Ins ruddy faco to the earth when nearest to it. The continents of Mars, the Arctic regions, the seasons were glanced at, and the remarkable canals of the planet, probably\" 2,000 miles long and 50 or 60 miles wide, were placed on tho screen, by the oxy-hydrogan light./ The extraordinary thing about them was pointed'] out\u2014namely, that they were In duplicate. The Manchester man's explanation of this fact served to raise a laugh. Jit was that everything was done with such energy and business spirit on the planet, thab when a railway or ship canal was constructed it was made in duplicate, apparently to get rid. of the superfluous energy. The moons of Mars and their rapid progress j around the planet were afterwards glanced at, and Sir Robert, reasoning from the analogy of the highly-organised life of this earth, wonderfully adapted to its environments, whether it was in the I deserts of Africa, tbe solitudes of the Arctic regions, j or the deep sea where scarcely a ray of lights penetrated, said it was possible to believe thab all i the glorious planets were hung up, so to speak, for man to look at and admire. Each, he asserted, probably contained types of life specially suited to the conditions which the particular globe had to offer. A vote of thanks to Sir Robert brought j the proceedings to a close.

Professor E. E. Barnard, of the Lick Observatory, now famous as the dis- coverer of Jupiter's fifth satellite, is only about 40 years old. Only a few years ago he was earning a scanty living in a photo. graph gallery in Nash- ville, Tennessee. Being very fond of astronomy. he devoted his spare time to the study of it. He was so poor that it was a long time before he could afford to purchase the smallest telescope. Through the influence of a gentleman who recog- nised his ability, he became assistant instructor in astronomy at the Vanderbilt University. He there gave up his rights to the study of the heavens for comets,and he has probabiy discovered more than any living astronomer. When the Lick Observatory was opened he was given the place ot assistant observer. PROFESSOR ANTOINE. Professor Antoine, pre- sident of the French debates at the Birkbecb Scientific and Literary Institute, opened the first of the series which are to take place every Monday evening during the winter term. His subject, \"The Economic Aspects of Pro- duction by Machinery.\" was keenly debated. He argued that machinery was the cause of over- production, consequently slackness of work for the workmen, and hence poverty. PROFESSOR ANTOINE. I NTWMAN HALL'S SUCCESSOR. The Rev. F. B.

Having taken a University degree he began his ministration in 1869, when he became assistant pastor to the Rev. C. M. Borrell, of Liverpool. In 1872 ho accepted the pastorate of the Baptist Church, York, where he was eminently successful. In 1874 he took charge of Victoria-road Church, Lei- cester; but in 1876 he resigned his post to set on foot a movement, which should roach the masses who slay aloof trom all places of worship. The outcome was a great mission work carried on in Melbourne-hall, a building capable of holding 1,400 persons, which was alwuy- crowded to its utmost limit. In 1883 Mr. Meyer accepted the call of the congregation meeting in Regent's Park Chapel, where he was quite recently the recipient of a handsome presen- tation on accepting the important post he has now entered upon.

Only a few yenrs ago he was earning a scan', 1ivingin a photo- graph gallery in Nash- ville, Tennessee. Being very fond of astronomy, he devoted his spare time to the study of it. He was so poor that it was a long time before be could afford to purchase the smallest telescope.

He there gave tip his rights to the study of the heavens for comets, and he h is probably discovered more than any living astronomer. When the Lick Observatory was opened he was given the place of assistant observer. PROFESSOR ANTOINE. Professor Antoine, pre- sident of the French debates at the Hirkbeck Scientific and Literary Institute, opened the first of the series which are to take place every Monday evening during the winter term. His subject, \"The Economic Aspects of Pro- duction by Machinery.\" was keenly debated. He argued that machinery was the cause of over- production, consequently slackness of work for the workmen, and hence poverty. PFTOFESSOB ANTOINE. NHWMiN HALL'S SUCCESSOR. The Kev. F. B.

I wish in these simple notes to give some idea of the celestial phenomena for September, many of which can be followed with the naked eye, though, of course, a telescope vastly enhances the interest. It is scarcely necessary to add, the larger and more perfect the instrument the better, though a really good glass of only 2 \u00a3 in. or 3in, aperture will do 2 useful work as well as afford its owner an almost endless fund of amusement. Moreover, silvered- glass reflectory are so cheap nowadays that no one with any means to speak of need be long ere he obtains a trustworthy tetescope. Astronomical pheii^neua resolve themselves into two classes\u2014those capable of exact predic- tion and those whose occurrence is more or less uttendod with uncertainty. The former class includes the movements of the Bun, planets, and the like; the latter includes the apparition of comets and meteors, which, if capable of predic- tion at al1, can only be so approximately. Many of these phenomena are governed by laws which astronomers are gradually getting to understand, and the time may come when most ot the pheno- mena now comprehended in the second class will be transferred to the first. THE SUN.-We commence our notes with the sun, the first astronomical object to attract the attention of mankind, and the material source of our oomfort, nay, of our very existence. This tremendous luminary, distant from us some 92,000,000 miles (the exact figures have yet to be ascertained), is no less than 2,400,000 miles in cir- cumference. On his glorious disc appear from time to time spots of varying magnitude, which are easily seen even with a small telescope by letting the sun's rays fall through it and then focussing the resultant imoge on a piece of note paper or cardboard. These spots represent gaseous eruptions of stupendou- luagnitude, compared with which the most fearful catastrophes of earth are but as the bursting of ;\u25a0 bubble. In some mysterious way solar outbursts arc said to influence auro'se, to interfere with the weather, regulate harvests, commercial panics, and so on. There may be some truth in the least wild of these aesertions, but the whole subject obviously demands a vast deal of further investigation. What is certainly known is that sunspots have a period of about eleven years, their size and frequency waxing and waning in that interval of time. This was discovered many years ago by Schwabe, who thus earned scientific immortality solely by pertinaciously watching the sun and keeping a careful record of his observations. At the time of writing spots are of frequent J < JUPITER. 1",

TBY ARTHUR MEE, F.R.A.S.] As the yeax draws to a close the brilliant constellations we are wont to associate with the winter sky make their appearance in the even- ing heavens: glorious Orion, preceded by AIde- baran and the Pleiia-de-s, and followed by Fro- eyon and by Sirius, most splendid of the fixed stars. Of the planets. Jupiter is now in the ascendant. Mars still holds a conspicuous plaoe in the heavens, but is getting very decidedly smaller, ana. therefore, less interest- ing, in the telescope. So far as I cftn ascertain, the so-called \"oanals\" have not been generally seen in England this season, but they require good instruments, and. above all, good air. and the latter has for some time past been conspi- cuous by reason of its absence. Mars, to the general observer, is, after all, disappointing, and he turns with pleasure to Jupiter and the glorious disc that he presents in a very ordinary telescope. The great red spot that some years ago was so conspicuous in the southern hemi- sphere of the \"giant planet\" still lingers as a faint, yellowish stain. Mars just now crosses I an the meridian. about 25 minutes past- eight: Jupiter at a quarter-past one, but he is beauti- ful high in the ea-stern heavens long before the average public dream of retiring to rest. Neptune is now in opposition in Taurus. near the small star \"iota,\" buc the other planets are not worth looking for. The moon is full on the 12th inst. Two (very faint) comets are at present visible. The movement, for an astronomical society for Wales, with headquarters at Cardiff, is making good progress: it has the sympathy of such scientists as Principal Viriamu Jones, Professor Lloyd Tanner, Mr. Franklen Jbvans, and Mr. Whitmell, and has already a considerable mem- bership, comprising numerous beginners, a., well as practical observers. A meeting will be called in a few days, and intending members a.re requested to communicate with the writer at 41, Hamilton-street, Cardiff. ASTRONOMY AT CARDIFF. TO THE EDITOR OF THE EVENING EXPRESS.\" Sir.\u2014In such a centre of learning as Cardiff one naturally expects to find each branch of science strongly represented, and I was very glad to hear that a movement was on foot to band together the astronomically inclined in your district. Perhaps, in no study is associa- tion more beneficial than it is to the devotees of this chilly, yet beautiful, cult, and in a country like ours, where good observing weather is scarce, all that is possible should be done to foster amateur endeavour in each locality, so that every suitable moment may be utilised. The individual find.\" perfect opportunities all too few. but a. society such as is suggested for Cardiff may accomplish \"cod work by increasing the number of workers. Our ex- perience in Chester may be considered decidedly encouraging. Each year has seen a steady increase in our numerical strength, and. what- is more important, a vast improve- ment in our astronomical results. Of course, a fair amount of self-sacrifice on the part of a few of your leading scientists will be needed, but. headed by my friend Mr. Arthur Mee. I am sure that a band of earnest- workers will soon place the movement beyond failure. After three years of steady inrrea.se Chester can re- port enthusiastic and ii,telligent use of the many telescopes that its society commands. If your success in Cardiff is proportionate to your achievements in other fields, astronomy will be the richer for your labours, and with a hearty wish that this may lie so.\u2014I am. Ac., F. W.

                "full_text": "THE SKIES OF JUNE. I ,-By ARTHUR MEE, F.R.A.S.] 1 Though most people like to read about the heavens, the number of those who apply themselves to their study is extremely small, and the reasons assigned are usually these\u2014 that astronomy is a science of ultra-abstruse- ness, that it is of no practical value whatever, and that it is so difficult to identify the stars, which shine in myriads overhead that it is perfectly useless to attempt the task. Each of these ideas is absolutely erroneous. Astronomy is divided into two great sections, the first of which is concerned with the nature of the stars, the second with their whereabouts. This last department is, indeed, abstruse, but with- out it navigation would be almost impossible, and the world would be robbed of its present means of obtaining absolutely correct time, j But we have no need to concern ourselves with this department, when the first is displayed invitingly before us. Here is no need of mathematics. All that is required is a, good eye and an opera-glass or telescope, and the desire to learn something of the wonders and beauties of the universe. To the studv of this department \u2014 observational u-stronomy \u2014 the reader is invited, and he or she will find it, if persevered in, one of the most fascinating of pursuits. As for the hopelessness of learning the stars, let us examine it a little more closely. Look up at the sky at nine o'clock one of these early June evenings, and you will find I that but very few of the stars are of any con- spicuous order of brightness. Indeed at this 1,, ->a non1.\" three of the most brilliant are I above the horizon\u2014Capella, Vega, and Arc- turus. By reference to our little map (a very rough one, be it noted), the reader will iind A returns, a fine orange star, high up in the southern heavens, whilst the electric gleam of Vega. is instantly descried in the east, and Capeila low down in the north-west. Gither stars>, conspicuous enough, but less bright than this grand trio, will be noted, such as Castor and Pollux, Spica, Regulus, and the seven stars of the Bear the latter are most useful as guides\u2014the Bear's ta.il always guiding the eye to Axcturus, whilst lines through the square of stars, forming the body of the plough or the hind quarters of the bear, point in one direction to the pole- star; in another to Vega, in another to (Japella, in another to the Lion, and so OD. Thus, step by step, we advance to a. knowledge of the stars and constellations, a knowledge winch may be further developed by that most delight- ful of books, Dunkin's \"Midnight Sky\" (a few edition of which was published lately by the Religious Tract Society), and the more advanced atlases of Proctor and Rail. The bright star, Spica, which is to be seen in the south ip our map, is an excellent guide to Saturn, which shines to north of it with equal brilliancy: the ring system of Saturn renders it, as everyone knows, one of the most striking and conspiouous objects in the heavens. Of the other planets, Mercury and Uranus are evening stars, Venus a morning star, and Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune in- visible. The moon is new on the ?rd, full on the ISt-h.",

This is the planet Venus, which aa the weeka pass will become a more and more brilliant and conspicuous object in the evening heavens. The gradual increass of her brightness and the shitt of her position amongst the star3 are well worth watching. now FAR DOES SOUND TRAVEL? It is interesting to note the very varying behaviour of sound. From my oor the bells of Llandaff Cathedral (distant about a mile) are sornstimes loud to a startling degree; at other time., (with apparently similar atmos- pheric conditions) not a s-und can be heard. Why is this, I recollect reading somewhere that Carmarthen bells have be:n heard at Llan- d:!o, twpive or thirteen miles distant; but, surely, this roquires confirmation. Of course. the great distance at which cannon can be heard is well known. Cannon cfT Milford have been heard as far as the confines of Hereford- shire! I should much like to hear tho opinion cf correspondents on these matters. NAKED-EYE OBSERVATION. So many peqpie have a rooted idea that no one can do a useful astronomical observation without, optical assistar.c?. that it sjives me much pleasure to draw the attention of such to the interesting series of articles on Astronomy Without a Telescope,\" now ap- pearing in \"Knowledge,\" from the able pen of E. Walter Maunder. Doubtless, the idea alluded to is one of the principal reasons why astronomy is not far more widely taken up. May Mr. Maunder do much to dissipate it. In the January number of the same valuable and attractive journal the Rev. J. M. Bacon discusses some results of his recent aerial voyage, and there is another article of local interest, on \"Explosions in Coal Mines.\" NOTABLE METEORS. Mr. Norman Lattey (Cardiff) states that on Thursday evening, about 9.23, he saw the most magnificent meteor he had ever witnessed. Its flight, which lasted three or four seconds, was from near the star Gamma Andromedae to below the square of Pegasus. The meteor was fully six times as bright as Venus at her brightest, and was somewhat the shape of an Indian club. The thickest part (the head) was a pale bluish green, intensely bright, iae \"ail tapered off to a point, was of a deep red. fringed with violet, and followed by a smoky train. Did any other reader see this object? Mr. ,T. F. Young fLlanolly) describes a meteor seen by him on October 13, at C.15 p.m. It left behind it a straight, jilvery, broad streak of considerable length, for some 18 seconds.. The observation was corroborated by a friend.",

Every one of these E'ear evenings after sun- set. a brisrht star may be seen shining above the W.S.W. horizon. This is the planet Venus, t which as the weeks pass will become a more and more brilliant and conspicuous object in the evening heavens. The gradual increase of her brightness and the shift of her position amongst the stars are well worth watching. HOW FAR DOES SOUND TRAVEL? It is interesting to note the very varying behaviour of sound. From my loor the bells of Llandaff Cathedral (distant about a mile) are sometimes loud to a startling degree; at other times (with apparently similar atmos- pheric conditions) not a sound can be heard. Why is this? I recollect reading somewhere that Carmarthen bells have been heard at Llan- d'io, twelve or thirteen miles distant; but, surely, this requires confirmation. Of course, the great distance at which cannon can be heard is well known. Cannon off Milford have been heard as far as the confines of Hereford- Ehire!

Mr. Norman Lattey (Cardiff) states that on Thursday evening, about 9.23, he saw the most magnificent meteor he had ever witnessed. Its flight, which lasted three or four seconds, was from near the star Gamma Andromedse to below the square of Pegasus. The meteor was fully six times as bright as Venus at her brightest, and was somewhat the shape of an Indian club. The thickest part (the head) was a pal bluish green, intensely bright. :-Lie 'ail tapered off to a point, was of a deep red. fringed with violet: and followed by a smoky train. Did any other reader see this object? Mr. J. F. Young (Llanelly) describes a meteor seen by him on October 13. at 8.15 p.m. It left behind it a straight, silvery, broad streak of considerable length, for some 18 seconds. The observation was corroborated by a friend.",
