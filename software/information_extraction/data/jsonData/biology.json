Spencer Harrison, A.R.C.Sc., Forbes Medallist, be appointed demonstrator and assistant lecturer in biology for a period of three years. Mr. Harrison is 24 years of age. He was edu- cated at King Edward's Grammar School, Aston, Birmingham, and has sincc studied biology and physiology at the Birmingham and Midland Institute, and Mason College, Birming- ham. In 1894 he entered the Royal College of Science, London, with a national tchoiarsliip in biology, and lie is now an Associate of the college in zoology (first class). He was awarded tue Forbes Medal and prize for biology. He holds fivst-class science and art certificates in advanced botany and advanced physiology, and has taken first-class honours in zoology. He has also obtained a fivst class in the matricula- tioa examination of the University of London. He has an intimate knowledge of French and German. Duriiier the Ion? vacation of 1896 he was associated with Mr. Swale Vincent, M.B., in a research the result of which appeared as a joint paper, \"On the Hasolymph Glands of Some Vertebrates,\" in the Journad of Anatomy and Physiology for January, 1837. LATE ARCHDEACON GRIFFITHS. The following resolution was unanimously passed: \u2014\"This council desires to record the deep regret with which, in connection with his I fellcw-countryraen, it deplores the recent death of Archdeacon Griffiths. It calls to mind the warm and earnest advocacy with which, in the earliest days of the higher Welsh education, he promoted the foundation of the Univeis-ity Col- lege of Aberystwith, and cherishes in grateful remembrance the service he rendered to this college to the latest period of his life. This council further desires to convey to his sorrow- ing widow this expression, and its esteem for her late honoured husband, and sympathy with herself.\"",

Professor Huxley delivered his first lecture yesterday morning,at the Royal School of Science, South Kensington. since his return from America. The learned scientist did not seem any the worse for his visit to the States, although a trifle paler than usual. After a few introductory re- marks, he plunged at once into his subject, biology, which, by tho way, has nothing to do with electro-biology, psy- chic force.\" or spir itual ism. To explain what is meant by biology, it may be briefly said that all natural objects ad- it of an obvious separation into two primary groups, according as they are dead or alive\u2014according as they exhibit no phenomena except such as can readily be referred to the working of known physical and chemical laws, or they present, in addition, tha phenomena which we are accustomed to group under the name \"vital.\" The studies which occupy themselves with dead bodies concern the physician, the chemist, the geologist, the mathematician, and the mineralogist. The study of living beings, irrespective of the nature and position of these, is the province of biology, derived from the Greflk words bios, life, and logos, a discourse, meaning the science ot life; or, in other words, what has until late years been termed natural history. All living beings, however, may be dividtd into the two kingdoms of animals and plants; the study of the former constituting the department of zoology, whilst botany is ex- clusively concerned with the latter. In accordance with this division, biology splits up into these kindred sciences, although they form really only one discipline, as Professor Huxley points out, which is divided only as a matter of convenience; for the scientific zoologist should no more be ignorant of the fundamental phenomena of veget able life than tire scientific botanist of those of animal exis- tence. Professor Huxley then went exhaustively into the Subject, the report of which is more fitted for the pages of a scifentific journal than the columns of a newspaper. The learned professor was, p,s usrtal, clear in his definitions and eloquent in diction, and received from those who had the pleasure of listening to him a genial and hearty welcome back to the sphere of his labours.",

I SANDOWN* PARK, Thursday Morning To-day. as the usual prelude to the Grand Military Meeting, the Sandown executive promises an interesting open programme, and they will then for the next two days hand over the management to the military authorities. The meeting is always the most fashionable of the winter season, and as the Indies in particular delight to see the soldiers disport themselves in the saddle it only re- quires fine weather to ensure the presence of a numerous and gay company. To-day the chief event is the Liverpool Trial Steeple- chase, and if this three miles and a half race attracts a field in keeping with the entry the contest will be an Aintree trial in fact as well as in name. I expect the chief com- petitors will be Biology, Longthorpe, What Next, Communist, and The Actuary.

At a meeting of the council of the North Wales college, recently held at Bangor, a report was sub- mitted ay the special committee appointed to con- sider the financial position of the college, and estimates were adopted with the view of meeting the deficit which wonld ensue on the termination of the Jubilee Fund iR 1892, it being resolved also that the friends of the college be appealed to f9r annual subscriptions, so as to extend the usefulness of the institution. It was resolved that the vacancy in the chair of modern languages be filled up in January by the appointment of a professor of French and German at a stipend of \u00a3 200, together with one-half fees, guaranteed up to \u00a3 50. The question of the Welsh lectureship was again considered, and it was resolved that a Welsh lecturer be appointed at a stipendofXIOO. Mr E. V. Arnold, lecturer in Latin, and Mr R. W. Phillips, lecturer in biology, were appointed professors of Latin and biology respec- tively. A spontaneous offer on the part of the professors, made in view of the financial position of the college, to receive from 1892 a smaller proportion of fees, was accepted, and a resolution was passed gratefully acknowledging the self-sacrifice and public spirit of the professors. It was resolved that in future there be two scholar assistants in classics.",

Several highly-interesting papers were read to large audiences. The main fea: nre in the day's proceedings was Sir G. Wyvilla 1 Thomsons' address at the geography section, in which he dealt with the brilliant results of Mr Stanley's African expedition, referring to Arctic and other explorations. He declared that their result had been to give us an improved idea of the physical condition of the ocean. Two facts especially, being made'clearin the first place, there there was a deposit of a chalky character ron. stantly going on some few hundred miles a way from land, and secondly, that the ocean averaged 2,000 fathoms in depth, and nowhere exceeded 5,000. Papers were also read by Professor Houghton on mathematical and physical science, Mr John Evans on geology, Professor W. H. Fowler on biology, Dr Ingram on economic science and statistics, and Mr Edward Easton on mechanical science.

At the meeting of the British Association on Friday, the chiet interest was centered in the Biology section, in which addresses were delivered by Profe\",sor Huxiev, Dr R. McDonneU, and Sir John Lubbock. The I&st mentioned read a paper on \"The h\u00a1\u00a1.bit of antH.\" He had kept thirty in connnement since 1874, and had found that their sence of smell was very deHcute. He had no proof that they could hear. but had satisfied himself they could distinguish colours. The communi- ties of anta offered numerous analogies to those of men, and the diS'erent species of ants pre- sented various conditions of life, curiously an- swering to the earlier stages of hum<m progress. viz.,the limiting the paatoral and the agricultural. An introductory address delivered by Pro- fessor Huxley in the anthropological department of biology. He denied that anthropology had anything tn do with the diSerent religious systems, and insisted on the exb-te'ice of pre-Adamite m&n. Undoubted proof of this had been found in the sh&pe of fossil remains.",

                "full_text": "PROFESSOR HUXLEY ON BIOLOGY. The theatre of South Kensington Mnieum was crowded to overflowing on Saturday night by an audience assembled to hear a free lecture given by Profesior Huxley on the subject of Biology. Dividing his remarks under four heads, Mr. Huxley showed what biology la, why it should be studied, and how and when it should be studied: Biology, he explainad, was a science which covered all the phenomena of living things as distinguished from those not living, and therefore related to animals and plants. Undoubtedly, under \"Biology,\" necessarily including man, they might include all man's works, and thus embrace civil as well as natural history but as thete were about a quarter of a million varieties of animals which biologists had to know something about, they tacitly agreed to a sort of practical convention by which they gave up altogether the branches of what might be called civil history, which was? a department by itself known under the head of sociology. Biologists had permitted that provincs to be autonomous, but it must not be sup- posed that the biologist was trespassing in dealing occasionally with politics or meddling with human education, because, after all, these were parts of his province, which he bad only voluntarily forsaken. (Applause.) On the question of why this science should be studied, possibly the time might come when it would seem an odd kind of question to ask why we should not feel an interest in what constitutes our own life, but at present, judging by the practice of teachers and doctors, that would seem to be a matter which did not concern us at all. He himself agreed with the sentiment of Thomas Hobbes, of Malmesbury, that \"the scope of all speculation is the performance of some action or thing to be done.\" He had not any very great respect for or interest in mtre \"knowing\" as such. He judged the nature of human pursuits by their bearing upon human interests, or in other words by their utility. (Applause.) But he should like that they should quite clearly understand what he meant by the word utility.\" In an Baglishman's mouth it generally meant \"getting on.\" (Laughter.) Every kind of knowledge was useful in proportion as it tended to give people right ideas, which were the essential foundation of all right practice, and to re- move wrong ideas, which were the fertile mother of every description of error in practice and inaimuch as this world was absolutely governed by ideas, and often by the wildest and most hypothetical ideas, it was a matter of great importance that our knowledge of things and theories, which seem far apart from our daily lives, should be as far as possible true, and as far as possible removed from error. It was in this sense that he judged of the value of biology by its utility, and he should be prepared to point out the full neces- sity for the use of biology in a great many of the affairs of life, especially this life of ours in the J9th century. Most people laid great stress and right stress upon the conception they entertained of the position of man in this universe, and his relation to the rest of nature. Meat people had keen told, most people held Ltill, that man occupied an isolated and peculiar position in nature-tbat he is in the world but not of the world, and that his relations with things about him are of a remote character that his origin is recent, his career is likely to be short and that he is the great oentral figure around which the rest of things in this world, like a set of marionettes, gyrate. This was not what biologists told us-and for his present argument they might be all wrong. Biologists told us that all this was an entire mistake. They turned to the physical organisation of men they examined his whole structure, his bone framework and its clothing. They resolved him into the finest particles which the microscope would enable them to break up; they con- sidered his various functions and activities; they looked at the manner in which he was ooncernea on the surface of the world, and then they turned to the animal world and taking the first handy animal\u2014say a dog-tbey professed te be able to demonstrate that the analysis cf a dog leads to the same results in gross as the analysis of a man. They find almost identically the same bones having the same relation to each other. They can trace the nerves of a dog and the nerves of a man, and they fiad that the regions of sense are found in man and are found in the dog. They analyse the brain and the spinal cord, and they find what does for the one does for the other. Moreover, they trace back the dog and the man, and find that at a certain stage the two creatures are not distinguishable the one from the other. They find the dog has a distribution over the surface of the world comparable to that of the human species; and what is true of the dog they find to be true of all the higher mammals, and that for the whole of these creatures they can lay down a plan comprising all in one great fundamental unity. Investigatione of this kind proceeded step by step, and gradation by gra- dation, from man at the summit to a certain animated jelly at the bottom of the scale, so that the idea of Liebnitz that animals formed a graduated scale, although not exactly in the form he pro- pounded, turned out to be essentially correct. More than that if the investigation were pursued in the vegetable kingdom, you went from the gigantic oak until you came down to a speck of animated ]euy which it was difficult to distinguish from the lowest animal Biologists had arrived at the conclusion that there was unity of animal and vegetable action, and that all varieties were but gradations of the same great plan. It was admitted that a great gulf separated ma. from the lower animals; but the difference was a difference of degree, not of kind. Amongst animals were found various faculties, especially mimicry. There were architects among them, so that the architects could not claim exemption. (Laughter.) But there was no sculpturing animal, no modelling animal, and no drawing animal. He men- tioned this so that such comfort might be derived from it as artists might like to draw. (Laughter.) If what biology told were true it would be necessary to get rid of \"mas and hia place in Nature,\" and to substitute his real place, and such substitution was only pos- sible by man putting himself in a position in whioh he would be able to some extent to appreciate the nature of the arguments which biologists had to offer. On this point Professor Huxley ridiculed his critics, who he maintained had not even mastered the alphabet of the subject. He then drew attention to the possible use of biology in relation to ascertaining the true nature of the germ) of infectious disease, he pointed to the revolution in agriculture during the laat forty years due largely to the theories of Liebig and to the precise definition of certain processes which go on in plants, and which are parts of the subjects of biology. Granting the use of studying biology, Mr. Huxley argued that mere reading was of little value without actual observation and experiment. Although there were about 100,000 species of insects, yet any- body who knew the structures of a properly-choeen insect would have a fair conception of the structure of the whole. In fact, there were such things as types of form in animals and vegetables, and for the purpose of getting precise knowledge of what constitutes the leading forms of animal and plant life it was not needful to actually examine more than a com- paratively small number of specimens. In his own laboratory the students were shown the structure of water weeds, ferns, the common polyp, earthworms, snails, lobsters, cray-fiah, black beetles, common skate, cod-fish, tortoise, and pigeon or rabbit. With recard to museums as at present arranged, Professor Huxley drew a humorous picture of the visitor trudging through a quarter of a mile of animals more or less well stuffed, and with all their names written out underneath them-(laughter)-and unless the experience of others was different from his own, the upshot of it was that they left the splendid pile with sore feet. a headache, and a general impression that the animal kingdom was a mighty maze without a plan. For the use of scientific students, he would have the skins and skeletons of animals, and for the general public few specimens of more distinctive animals, and a brief statement of their nature and mode of life. On the fourth point, when biology should be studied, he saw no valid reason why it should not be part of an ordinary school training, illustrations to be given in the first instance from plants, to be followed at a later stage, and among older pupils, with the oommoner animals. Especially was the study commended to those who intended to follow the profession of medicine. With this remark, and with another word of advice to Messieurs the critics to get a little sound practical elementary instruction, Professor Huxley concluded a lecture that had engaged the closest attention of an evidently appreciative assembly for upwards of an hour.",

                "full_text": "BRITISH ASSOCIATION. Open of the Proceedings at the 63rd Annual Meeting. Proceedings in connection with the sixty- third annual meeting of the British Association began at Nottingham on Wednesday. The general committee met under the presidency of Sir Archibald Geikie, when the report was adopted. It was stated that the association financially was now in a much better position than during the past two years, there being a balance on the right side. A large number of members have arrived in Nottingham, including several Continental scientists of distinction. Bournemouth and Ipswich have sent deputations inviting the association to visit those towns in 1895. In the evening Professor J. S. Burdon-Sander- son, M.A., LL.D., &c., delivered his presi- dential address. He paid a tribute to the influence exerted during the past half-century by the British Association, and pleaded elo- quently for adequate Government recognition of the claims of science. Proceeding to address the meeting on the nature and history of biology, the professor stated that the term was unknown till after the beginning of the present century, and went on to refer in a special manner to the first philosopher to employ the term, Treviranus, whose labours were next succinctly alluded to. To Treviranus we owe the first scientific con- ception of the science of life as a whole, and this conception could in the present state of knowledge still be accepted as true. Dividing biology into three great branches, the president dealt specially with one of these \u2014 physiology\u2014the foundations of which were practically laid by Johannes Miiller. He it was who, of physiologists, first comprehended the supreme importance of \u2022xperiment as distinguished from specu- lation, and thus brought about a great advance in this department of science. Miiller introduced the term specific energy,\" and on the speeific energies of the organism the president proceeded to touch, giving several examples from the organ and phenomena of vision. Closely connected with biology was experimental psychology, which was destined to exert a helpful influence on the science cf life, and good would arise from the opposing standpoints of the experimentalist r nd the psychologist mutually balancing each oth\u00ab \u2022. As regards administrative efficiency in matters relating to public health England was at one time far ahead of all other coun- tries, and still retained its superiority; but as regards scientific knowledge we were content to borrow from our neighbours, and to go, say, to the Pasteur Institute in Paris to obtain what England ought long ago'to have provided, for to us, from the spread of our race all over the world, the prevention of acute infectious diseases was more important than to any other nation.' Strong as were the claims of pure science, even stronger still were those of the application of science to the dis- covery of the causes of acute diseases. Con- cluding, the professor submitted that he had endeavoured to show in which way biology was separated from the exact sciences. But though, so separated, the questions dealt with were cognate. Without forgetting that every phenomenon had to be regarded with reference to its useful purpose in the organism, the aim of the physiologist was not to inquire into final causes, but to investigate processes- to ask always How, rather than Why.",

                "full_text": "BRITISH ASSOCIATION. Open of the Proceedings at the 63rd Annual Meeting. Proceedings in connection with the sixty- third annual meeting of the British Association began at Nottingham on Wednesday. The general committee met under the presidency of Sir Archibald Geikie, when the report was adopted. It was stated that the association financially was now in a much better position than during the past two years, there being a balance on the right side. A large number of members have arrived in Nottingham, including several Continental scientists of distinction. Bournemouth and Ipswich have sent deputations inviting the association to visit those towns in 1895. In the evening Professor J. S. Burdon-Sander- son, M.A., LL.D., &c., delivered his presi- dential address. He paid a tribute to the influence exerted during the past half-century by the British Association, and pleaded elo- quently for adequate Government recognition of the claims of science. Proceeding to address the meeting on the nature and history of biology, the professor stated that the term was unknown till after the beginning of the present century, and went on to refer in a special manner to the first philosopher to employ the term, Treviranus, whose labours were next succinctly alluded to. To Treviranus we owe the first scientific con- ception of the science of life as a whole, and this conception could in the present state of knowledge still be accepted as true. Dividing biology into three great branches, the president dealt specially with one of these \u2014 physiology\u2014the foundations of which were practically laid by Johannes Midler. He it was who, of physiologists, first comprehended the supreme importance of 3xperiment as distinguished from specu- lation, and thus brought about a great idvance in this department of science. Midler introduced the term\" specific energy,\" md on the specific energies of the organism the president proceeded to touch, giving several ixamples from the organ and phenomena of vision. Closely connected with biology was experimental psychology, which was destined JO exert a helpful influence on the science of nic, auu. gvuu w wu-ivA. arioc xiuui i opposing standpoints of the experimentalist and the psychologist mutually balancing each other. As regards administrative efficiency in matters relating to public health England was at one time far ahead of all other coun- tries, and still retained its superiority; but as regards scientific knowledge we were content to borrow from our neighbours, and to go, say, to the Pasteur Institute in Paris to obtain what England ought long ago to have provided, for to us, from the spread of our race all over the world, the prevention of acute infectious diseases was more important than to any other nation. Strong as were the claims of pure science, even stronger still were those of the application of science to the dis- covery of the causes of acute diseases. Con- cluding, the professor submitted that he had endeavoured to show in which way biology was separated from the exact sciences. But though, so separated, the questions dealt with were cognate. Without forgetting that every phenomenon had to be regarded with reference to its useful purpose in the organism, the aim of the physiologist was not to inquire into final causes, but to investigate processes- to ask always How, rather than Why.",

I have been reading some suggestive and inter- esting remarks by Dr. Archdall Reid on temper- ance regarded from a biological point of view- that is to say, the standpoint which the student of life science might adopt in discussing the whole complex question of alcoholism. Just as Mr Spencer shows that society may be compared to a living organism in respect to the laws which regu- late it, and the conditions under which it flourishes or decays, so Dr. Reid views the question of alcohol from a similar coign of 'vantage. This is the calm region wherein the philosopher dwelleth. He is not concerned with the noisy arguments of prohibitionists or others of that ilk. He has to note the, place and power of alcohol and its effects on the race, and seeks to study the matter in the light of that theory of evolution which already has thrown so much light on dark places of inquiry. Dr. Reid is himself an evolutionist, and a thoughtful one to boot, and his previous studies on human developments entitle him to a respect- ful hearing when he comes to discuss temperance regarded as a factor in the evolution of the human estate. As might be expected, Dr. Reid, like every other evolutionist, regards man as a being who is still undergoing developments. lhat man is so being modified in many ways nobody who has any acquaintance with biology can doubt. He is losing his wisdom teeth, his jaws are being further shortened, a little offshoot of his intestines is (it is to be hoped) becoming obsolete, and in many other ways and directions we are presumably becoming like the\" angels,\" for whoiie sphere and general belongings the late Lord Bsaconsfield expressed so strong a predilec- tion.",

This is particular!)* the case with regard to botany and physiology and that the standard attained, especially in the practical part of biology, is lower may be partly due to the shortness of the time that the subject has been taught- I am glad to be able to add that the sketches with which the senior girls illustrated their answers indicate considerable improvement in that respect since last year but I would suggest that still more attention should be paid to this important matter.

                "full_text": "PROFESSOR HOXLEY ON BIOLOGY. There was a very large attendance of members and visitors to hear the opening address of Pro- fessor Hoxley, the president of the Biology section of the British Association. The crowd was so great that a proposal was made to adjourn to an- other place, but the learned professor intimated that he had no power to modify the arrangements of the council. Professor Hoxley commenced his addres by an announcement which caused no little laughter. He was excessively flattered, he said, at so large a number of the people of Nottingham showing that they felt an interest in science, but he warned them that his discourse would be an exceedingly dry one on abstract principles, and that, as far as he knew, there would be no quarrelling and no heresy -two great inducements to large audiences. He merely 0 wished to explain from his point of view the scope of what was called the science of biology, and the object of those whose pursued it\u2014as well as the leading divisons of the subject, and how they r, grouped themselves, and stood in relation to other branches of knowledge. Selecting, for example, the egg of a hen and the seed of a bean stalk, he asked his audience to consider what they where. There was no chick in the egg, nor was there any- thing in the nature of a plant in the bean or any other seed. There was a certain rudimentary out- line of the one or the other, but the thing itself was assuredly not present in either of these cases. When the egg was exposed to the process of in- cubation, and the seed planted in the ground and supplied with moisture and warmth, Z, they knew what took place after a certain time in those two things. Out of the apparently formless mass\u2014the egg\u2014there issued a creature full of life and activity, and with instincts above the lower forms of mental action, which took the shape of a chick, and pass- ing through a succession of changes became a fowl. On the other hand the bean struck out a root, sent a stem upwards, put out leaves and flowers, and eventually became a bean stalk, and gave rise to all the products arising from such plants. Now, what he wished to draw attention to was, that in the whole set of changes arising from a single egg or seed, there was a certain definite order and suc- cession of forms, and the study of biology applied to the whole of that series of forms, to which they gave the name of developments If, however, a man only devoted himself to the study of the dif- ferent forms r.nd the order of succession, and took no account of the causes of the various stages of development, he would but possess the knowledge of the anatomist, and he would not have complied with the entire list of sciences vhich grew out of the study of the forms of living things. The earth Z, 11 had existed for millions and millions of ages, and the vast succession of living beings which had existed upon it had not remained the same. The farther they went back into the abyss of time the form of them became more and more different. All they knew was that there had been a mechanism of new forms, and the ascertainment of those forms was called paleaeontoiogv, a term to which the geo- logists had no claim. Then there were the ques- tions of distribution with regard to time and space. What were the causes of all those things ? Why were there no palms h?re, and no oaks in Green- land? How bad this living matter come about at all, and how was it related to the other forms or forces we found in the universe ? All these branches of enquiry are dependent on those already men- tioned, and come under the term physiology,' but with a wider meaning than that generally given to the word. He meant by physiology an inquiry into the existence of living beings, and into the causes which led to their modification, and to what they now are. That was the line of inquiry sketched out by Dr. Darwin, and whatever opinion might hereafter be held as to the specific value 01 the results he arrived at, no philosophical person, no thinker worthy to be so called, could doubt that his name would go down to posterity as the man who first organised this branch of study. (Cheers). Such was, in his point of view, a sketch of the dif- ferent branches of biological science. The great point of his argument was that two things were included under biology\u2014an inquiry into forms simply, and next an inquiry into forces and causes. It was possible to know all aoout the forms of anatomy, and to know nothing about physiology. Over the door of the department of Physiology ought to be written the words, Let no man enter here who does not study physics and chemistry.' He concluded by supporting the present arrange- ments in this section, observing that if scientific knowledge were more generally diffused, be saw no objection to the whole divisions being allotted to one section, entitled Biology.'",

                "full_text": "PROFESSOR HUXLEY ON BIOLOGY. Professor Huxley gave a lecture on Saturday even- ing at the lecture theatre of the South Kensington Museum on The Systematic Study of Biology.\" It was one of the free science lectures given in connection with the Loan Collection of Scientific Apparatus, and the hall was entirely filled, while many were unable to secure admittance. Professor Huxley said at the outset that he proposed te answer the questions\u2014What is biology ? Why should it be studied ? How should it be studied? When should it bo ntudied ? In answer to the first question he gave a brief historic sketch. The Greek philosophers after the time of Aristotle distinguished between a knowledge of nature apart from man's interference, and a knowledge ef man, his social arrangements, and his ways of thinking, After a reference to Bacon's recognition of the distinction, a quotation was read from Thomas Hobbes, in which allusion was made ta the knowledge of facts, which is called history, being divisible into two serte-firstly, the history of nature, such as ef metals, plants, animals, Ac. and, secondly, civil history which included the voluntary action of man. \"Natural knowledge\" from this time came gradually te have a definite meaning, and when the Royal Society was founded it was called the Royal Society for the Advancement of Natural Knowledge. As knowledge accumulated, it was found that th experimental sciences were more exact than the observational, and while mathe- matical studies and astronomy and chemistry were dis- tinguished by their special names, the term Natural History was used with regard to the icsidiuum, such as the history of plants and animals, of minerals and physio- logy. It was in this sense that Buffon and Linnaeus called themselves naturalists. At the beginning of thi; century a still further division was made in natural history.\" Naturalists recognised that the knowledge gained from a study of plants and animals was different in kind from that obtained from a study of minerals and the properties of bodies. In 1802, simultaneously, and apparently in- dependently, \u00bb German and two French naturalists pro. posed the word biologic\" for the whole study of living matter. The idea was accepted, grew, and we in England fcave for some time past used the word biology.\" Dr. Field, of Norwich had written to the lecturer to poiot c ut, on philological grounds, that the word is a bad one, as bios is applied only to human life, while zoe is applied to other animal life. Although he suggests a new term, Professor Huxl ey thinks it too late to change our present one. The exact limits of biology it is difficult to define. Among the lowest forms it is not always easy to determine what is living matter and what is not; and, again, if the polity of bees and the republic among wolves form properly a part of the study of biologists, why should not the similar arrangements anon; men ? They had, however, voluntarily given over such subfects to the sociologists. In reply to the second question,Professor Huxley said he regarded study as useful when it gave right ideas, from which right actions might spring. The world is governed by ideas, and it is im- portant ideas should be as far as possible removed from error. Bioloay gave us important teaching regarding man's place in naturf, corrected the old notions about his recent origin, shewed how in structure and function he was like other animals, and removed tue idea he was the all-important central feature in the universe. It further, in matters of fact, taught us much that was valuable in regard to the germ theory of disease, and among many other cases that might be cited it put an entirely new aspect on agricultural operations. In speaking of how biology should be studied, the Professor urged that mere reading is of little good. \"Sense impressions of what is meant by the expressions used can only be gained by practical -L laboratory work. It is not requisite to dissect all forms known, but if is important to go through carefully a course of dissection of type forms. These give sense impressions npart from what is gained from books or lectures. When once ideas are thus associated with words or phrases, t,he description of other animals and plants can be followed from reading, the correct sense impressions being pro- dnced. The types used in the course given by Professor Huxley in his lectures at the School of Mines were re- ferred to as containing all that was absolutely needed. Properly-prepared specimens in museums are of great value, but we need very different arrangements from those now in vogue. We want certain selected type specimens for the general public and the mass ot the collections kept for real extended study. The public is not instructed by seeing a hundred specimens of a sparrow. Such detail is for men of science. The public need teaching in a simple way. As regards the time for biological teaching, Pro- fessor Huxley repeated what he bad said before\u2014that it may in a simple way be introduced in elementary schools, and that dissection may be commenced by studeuts, at nljout 13 or 15 years of age, u.ider direction.",

                "full_text": "CEREMONY AT THE NORTH WALES UNIVERSITY COLLEGE. OPENING NEW LABORATORIES. PROFESSOR FOSTER UPON BIOLOGY. A ceremony ot apparently widespread interest was performed before a crowded, influential, and learned assemblage at the North Wales^Univer.sity College, Bangor, on Saturday morning. The many invitations issued by the council and senate of the college, requesting attendance at the open- ing of the new biological laboratory, were mostly responded to in person, consequently the scene of the ceremony was packed, the ladies forming a goodly proportion of those present. It was great good fortune that secured the services of Pro- fessor Michael Foster, M.D., secretary of the Royal Society, and professor of physiology at the University of Cambridge, to do the formal open- ing, but the council were more than fortunate in the opening address that Professor Foster was in- duced to deliver, for it was generally felt to be one of the finest of the professor's well-known expositions. The address was little broken by the applause from the audience, but prolonged cheering was accorded the speaker at the close. Mr Richard Davies, M.P. (Lord-lieutenant of Anglesey), and vice-president of the college, occu- pied the chair, supported on either side by Pro- fessor Foster and the Principal of the col- lege. There were also present, the Bishop of Bangor, Lady Penrhyn, the Hon. Eleanor and Miss Douglas Pennant, Mr John Roberts, M.P. (honorary treasurer), Principal Reichel and the professional staff of the college, Professor Darwin (Cambridge), A. W. Scot (Lampeter College), Harvey Gibson (Liverpool University College), Alderman Brown (Mayor of Chester), Archdeacon Evans, and the Revs. W. Griffith, D. Evans, D. Davies, J. Morgan, T. J. Jones-Lewis, D. Manuel, Elijah Owen, Canon Pryce, R. E. Williams, D. Rowlands, R. W. Griffith, J. Wynne Jones, J. Fairchild, and J. Donne; Doctors R. A. Prichard, Jones, Morril, Rees, R. Williams, Risk, Davies, Parry, Richards, Prothero, O. Elias, Owen, Ro- berts, Rowland Jones, Thomas, Williams, Row- lands, Langford Jones, Grighton, Lloyd, Pryce, Hughes, John Roberts, H. R. Hughes, W. T. Mor- gan, and Roberts; Messrs W. A. Darbishire, A. Wyatt, M. Roberts, Bulkeley Price, Glynne Wil- liams, J. Thomas, T. C. Lewis, Henry Lewis, John Pritchard Roberts, William Pughe, W. Lewis, J. H. Rees, Richard Davies, Hugh Savage, K. Douglas, S. D. Orme, C. Davies, J. Thomas, R. Davies, W. Williams, Donald Cameron, and many others. The Principal read the following letters of apology for inability to attend the ceremony :\u2014 \"Fallowfield, Manchester, Sept. 24th, 1885. My Dear Sir,-I should much have liked to have joined your circle of friends who will assemble to meet Dr Foster, and who will celebrate the opening of your new laboratory. But other duties detainlme here. I congratulate you on starting with such excellent teaching machinery at so early a period of your academic history. We had to work and wait long at Owen's (College, Man- chester) before such advantages were placed within our reach in teaching biological science. So far as I am concerned I would gladly give up all lec- turing outside the laboratory provided I could gain the additional time for teaching within it. There the student can listen to the lecturer intel- ligently because he has the plant or animal in his hands about which the lecturer is discoursing. He thus sees the thing spoken of whilst the words describing it still ring in his ears. A marvellous aid to his apprehension and remembrance. Trust- ing to your new laboratories bringing to your students all the advantages that you may fairly expect from them.-I am, dear sir, very sincerely yours WM. C. WILLIAMSON.\" Owen's College, Sept. 25th, 1885. Dear sir,\u2014I very much fear that engagements here will prevent my coming to Bangor on the 3rd of October. I much regret this, as it would have given me great pleasure to be present at the opening of the Bio- logical Laboratory. I need hardly say that I heartily welcome all extension of biological teach- ing, and especially practical teaching; and I shall always be most happy to do anything in my power to assist in the establishment and equipment of of laboratories, especially at places where, as at Bangor, there are good facilities for obtaining material. Thanking you for your kindness sending me an invitation.-I remain, yours truly, A MILNEs MARSHALL.\" The Chairman in introducing Professor Foster said he had great pleasure in doing since he had kindly come down to give them an address at the opening of their new biological laboratory. He thought it was one of the great advantages they were deriving in that neighbourhood from the University College, that they were having now and again an opportunity such as that of hearing and seeing for themselves the great scientific men whose names and works were so familiar to them long before (applause). He was sure they would all feel that of Professor Foster, who needed no words of his as introduction. Before calling upon the Professor for his address, there was a deputa- tion from the North Wales Medical Association present to welcome the Professor and present him with an address''(applause). He now therefore called upon Dr Llovd Roberts to come forward and present the address (loud applause).\" THE PRESENTATION. Dr Lloyd Roberts (Denbigh), said as presi- dent of the North Wales Branch of British Medical Association, he begged to congratulate all connected With the college upon its inauguration\u2014(hear, hear, and applause) -and particularly on that occasion upon the inauguration of the biological department of that college. Actuated by a very natural sentiment, the members of the profession welcomed one so distinguished in science as Professor Foster, and had therefore attended there to present him with an address.\u2014The secretary of the association, Dr Jones Morris (Portmadoc), then read the following address To Professor Michael Foster, M.A., M.D., LL.D., Secretary F.R.S., University Professor of Physiology at Cambridqe. We, the president and council of the North Wales branch of the British Medical Association, on behalf of our members, beg to offer to you, on the occasion of your visit to inaugurate the bio- logical laboratory of the University College of North Wales, a most cordial welcome. We do so with more pleasure from the fact that you were at one time in your career, like ourselves, engaged in the onerous duties of a general practitioner, but animated by the promptings of a scientific genius, relinguished the more practical part of our pro- fession, and devoted yourself to the prosecution of that science which underlies the practice of medicine and surgery, and is well named, The Institute of Medicine.\" We congratulate the council of this young and promising institution, not only on the establishment of a lecture hall and laboratory for furnishing its students with a theoretical and practical knowledge of biological science, but also that they have made such a happy selection in inviting so distinguished a physiolo- gist as yourself to initiate its operations by deliver- ing the opening address. Of the excellence of that choice, we can speak in no measured terms. Your great services to the science of physiology are recognised and appreciated by the medical faculty throughout the world. We honour you, sir, as the careful painstaking investigator, the indefatigable student of the secrets of nature, the foremost physiological teacher in the British Isles, and the brilliant author of our standard work on physiology. In your capacity as Pro- fessor of Physiology in the University of Cam- bridge, you have so successfully laboured to obtain there for your students the means of original research, and of prosecuting the practical study of the sciences, and to establish upon a secure basis the reputation of that ancient seat of learning as a medical school, that its degrees in medicine now hold a position among the foremost and most coveted m the United Kingdom. Knowing, there- fore, the prominent place you, who are the secre- tary of the Royal Society, occupy among the leaders of science, and the respect and esteem in which you are held by medical practitioners, we feel that we cannot allow the present oppor- tunity to pass without expressing this sentiment which now permeates the profession in North | Wales. We trust that you may long live to con- i tinue your career of usefulness, and to enlighten and develop still further the domain of physiology. -We have the honour to be, your earnest well- wishers, J. Lloyd Roberts, M.B., president; T. Eyton Jones, M.D., vice-president; R. A. Richard, ex-president; W. Jones Morris, honorary secretary; John Richards, honorary treasurer; O. Elias Owen, Samuel Griffith, M.D., Hugh Rees, Robert Roberts, Charles Williams, J. Lloyd Williams. Professor Foster, in returning thanks, said he could assure the deputation he felt deeply touched at the address which they had just read to him, conveying sentiments so pleasurable, and to him an incident as unexpected as it was pleasing. As the address justly stated, he belonged to the medi- cal profession, and he had in all his physiological labours always endeavourned to point his teaching that it might be practically useful to his profession. As he should have occassion to further remark upon that he would simply again return his warm- est thanks for that very cordial address. (Applause) The deputation having retired, the chairman called upon Professor Foster to give his address in respect of the opening of the new laboratory. THE ADDRESS. Professor Michael Foster, was was loudly applauded upon rising, said that he imagined that in being asked to say some few words on that occasion, it would be expected that what he had to say referred to biological studies. First of all, let him ask the question, What is biology ?\" The word was not a good one, for, in the minds of many students, it called up ludicrous associations, such as staring at a small brass disc (laughter) and the word was also wrong like many other scien- tific words. Nevertheless the word had come into use, and they must, he feared continue to use it. Biology was of many different kinds. There were many men and women there who were imbued with the love of living things, and acquired a per- sonal acquaintance with living things some time or another. One would turn to plants and learn to know all the plants in the neighbourhood; learn to know them as it were personally. Another has the same feeling towards birds, another fishes, and such persons they call naturalists. Natura- lists were one kind of biologists, even though they should never care to think or inquire into the inner structure of the things they know, and live on asking no questions as to how they came about. Another man not caring for any living things would delight in the study of anatomy, and such facts as that which told that the knee^of a horse was not a knee, but only a knuckle, and he was a biologist of another kind. Then, there was a physiologist and the naturalist, and the studies of the connection between the dinerent forms of life, and of life and plants. It was as well that each separate branch should know something of each other, in fact, be acquainted with the whole. The biology of which he wished more particularly to speak was the biology dealing with the simpler forms, the biology dealing with the fundamental principles, the biology which was at the bottom of all the special branches (applause). Now, if he put the question why a biology of that kind should be taught in their University College of North Wales, he supposed he should receive two kinds of answers. One, that biology ought to be taught in the College as the means of helping the student in after days to earn his bread; and the other, that it should be taught as a means of general culture, with a professional end in view, and making the student a better and wiser man, and more fit to take his place in the world before him (applause). Let him first of all treat of it as an introduction to professional study. There was one profession for which a study of biology, which, if not a complete necessity, was at all events a great advantage, he meant the profession of medicine. Perhaps his medical brethren present would allow him to put for a moment the question, \"What was it that a doctor had to do.\" According to the statement of some people they might suppose all he had to do when called to a patient was to find out what was the matter with him, to give a name to his condition, to call it some difinite malady, and then being able to name the malady of his patient to produce the antidote or cure proper to that malady. He ventured to say on behalf of himself and his medical brethren present that that was not the doctor's mission, but it was rather to learn the actual nature of the disease. The essentials for medical success consisted in that knowledge of the nature of the disease, called pathology, and that knowledge of the organism which would enable the doctor to deal with it and .bring back the errant body to its normal condition (hear, hear). It was not because he was a physologist that he contended physiology was the basis of pathology, was the basis of the medical art, and he need hardly say he was delighted to have that state- ment undisputed in the address which they had just listened to. As a physiologist he could say that if physiology was to be learned with rapidity and completness, and with such grasp of its principles as was necessary for carrying it on to pathology, and then on to the medical art, then it was important that the medical student should have a grasp of the elementary principles of biology in general before he begans to work out for himself the special problems of physiology. It was a pity that students entering recognised schools should have to spend much of their time in studying physics and the elements of biology, and have finally to be crammed and coached in order to pass the examinations in their real studies of medicine. He maintained that that should not be (applause). The student should go to the medical school adequately prepared in the study of physics, chemistry and the elements of biology (hear, hear). The care of the human body was so serious a duty that the three years spent at a medical school were none too great to be devoted wholly to the grappling with disease itself (applause). But there was another profession to which he would venture.to say the knowledge of bio- logy was an advantage if not.necessary. The medical art was a negative art, it repaired or prevented, but the other art was the creative art, it was the biological art, inasmuch as it was the art ot con- verting dead mother earth into living material, he meant the art of agriculture (applause). This seemed to him to demand a wider knowledge, greater skill and clearer judgement than any other walk in human life (applause). The art of the farmer was based on nearly all the sciences especially on the science of biology.. It was the farmer's duty to do largely with feeding of cattle, and he had to produce out of a shilling's worth of fodder, the maximum of nutriment and fat. That was a physiological problem, and the matter could not be carried out properly and successfully by those absolutely ignorant of physiology (applause). The farmer had to take a few divers salts, and having placed in the earth, had to gather from the soils as much living material of a vegetable kind as under the circumstances of sun, climate and light, he could get. That was also largely a biological question. The treatment of the soil was partly a chemical problem, but know- ing what changes were going on in the soil, what quantities promoted life in the dead soil after the salts had been scattered upon it, in fact, the whole matter of the growth of corn out of soil became to a large extent a biological problem. He would venture, even at the expense of being said to be speaking upon matters upon which he had no authority to speak, to ask whether they thought the art of farming had already reached its maximum, whether they could get more cheaply flesh out of fodder, or whether they were wringing out of the soil as much yield as can ever possibly be got. He would ask them to remember what took place, how the farmer bought the salts at great expense, and how after the tablespoonful thrown on the land he was glad if he got a pinch back in the shape of wheat. Was it, therefore, not possible, by adequate manipulation of the so l for the art of horticulture showed the farmer how plastic was the life in that soil, and what might be made of it, he asked was it not possible that the tablespoonful should come back in its entirety to the farmer. Then if it would come back at the same expense of labour as a pinch would come, might not that strike the balance against the im- portation of foreign corn into this country, and enable the British farmer once more to lift his head (applause). He ventured to ask whether the real solution of their agricultural distress was not so much the division of land as the multipli cation of knowledge (applause). If elementary biology was to be of use as an introduction to these two great professions it must be taught well and rightly. Its principles must be laid down, and there must be through the whole course of instruction a care on the part of the teacher that the methods of biology are thoroughly observed and appreciated. No biology could be learned in a true fashion unless the student has already grasped the fundamental facts and principles of chemistry and physics. Those three formed a triple alliance, which he might venture to call a holy alliance, and one which he hoped would last longer than that of kings (applause). The study of biology included a broad knowledge of physics, a broad knowledge of chemistry, and at least an elementary knowledge of mathematics. Now he would be very bold and would ask, Is not this in itself a liberal education (hear, hear) ? There were many definitions of the term liberal edu- cation,\" but he was inclined to think the truest definition was that system which proved the most effective for bringing out the dormant powers of the individual being taught. He did not know what they thought, but he was much impressed with the tendency to uniformity and levelling which was going on everywhere around them. Just as the hand of time, with the fingers of snow and frost, of rain and wind, were gradually wearing down the picturesque crags of the Alps, and making a fertile, but monotonous, plain, so dress, speech, and character, were being rubbed down by civilisation, and we were being made all alike. There was a tendency to do the same thing and in the same way, for not only like sheep did we go astray, but like sheep also we would go straight (laughter and applause). There was a tendency under present civilisation to bring them to a dead level of monotonous mediocrity. And after all, what was it that was most effective in bringing about this state of things ? Was it not their sys- tem of education, supported by the terrible arm of examination with its fixed and rigid rules, which tended to drive every boy and girl through the same narrow gate (applause). It had been his lot to dabble in many different kinds of learning, and though as he passed from one to the other he generally forgot the foregoing, still he carried be- lief that whilst all studies might be considered good, none ought to be considered the best or in- dispensable. The true liberal education was that which helped a lad to know which would best suit his individual (character, and leave that alone which would not suit his character (hear, hear). The liberality of the education consisted not in the matter, but in the way in which it was im- parted, and he would ask them especially with regard to the profession which he represented, was it not preferable that the doctor who was called in should have been well learned in physical science rather than be a medical pracctitioner of liberal education who had merely smattered with physics, and other sciences, when in his youth (hear, hear). But biology was not only for the doctor or farmer, but was a science for all. It taught them to be exact, for exactitude was at the very bottom of biology. It taught the student to be constantly in the habit of seeing,\" not only in the laboratory, but outside (applause). It also brought out the faculty of judgment in the student, which was most useful.in after life. He had said nothing of biology as useful knowledge, and to tell the truth, he was not one of those who regarded the head of a youth as a portmanteau in which a large quantity of information may be stowed, and which it is hoped he may use on the journey through life. He found of that luggage a great deal was dropped on the way betore it is wanted, a great deal was spoiled and damaged before it was wanted, and a great deal was never wanted at all (laughter and applause). What they required in education was to his mind not so much useful knowledge as the training of the ability to lay hold of the useful knowledge when the time came for wanting it (hear, hear). But if he were to make an exception in favour of any kind of knowledge as being useful, he thought that he should claim as a real useful knowledge, a knowledge of those bodies which they carried about with them all their days (applause). A knowledge of physiology would (applause). A knowledge of physiology would foster an intelligent appreciation by the public of remedies for disease and keep them from being led away by remedies which were specious and impossible. There were two reasons why biology should be taught in that college, not only as pro- fessional study but for general culture. He held that it was the function of a college of that sort not only to teach but to learn. The professors should themselves be continually knocking at nature's door (applause), for the teacher would then be prevented from becoming mechanical in his work and devoid of that touch of iron which should enter the pupil's mind (hear, hear). There- fore for the sake of teacher and taught the work of research should be actively carried on within the walls of that college. They were educating everyone. Everywhere they were putting up new pumps to pump up the waters of knowledge over the heads of the people (laughter and applause), but let them remember that the well diggers were few and feeble. Each institution of that kind had a duty, not only to teach but to learn and he trusted that in years to come the University College of North Wales would be known not only as a place of teaching but also as a seat of learning (loud and prolonged applause). As to how biology should be taught there it should be taught in the laboratory since it came by observation and not by reading. Let him at that point congratulate them upon their new biological laboratories which though small were admirably fitted up and some- what put to shame some larger and richer institutions. The speaker in protesting against the principle of text book study gave an illustra- tion of what he meant. Whilst on a Swiss mountain admiring the scenery two German youths came up. Having drawn out their Baedeker they sat with their backs to the scene described therein, and after reading quietly got up and went down again (laughter). The labora- tories must be made a means and not an end, and from what he knew of their lecturer, his old pupil Professor Phillips (applause), he felt that in all he had said he had been speaking his sentiments only to a arreat extent. He knew that their lecturer would do his best to imbue the youths of North Wales who came to him with the true principles of biology as he had ventured to lay them down, and that everyone should actually work in the laboratory, keeping the end straight in view (hear, hear). Tnere was only one fear he had, and that was that Professor Phillips' teaching would be so successful that his laboratory will be found so small that the Council would have to decide to build another (loud and prolonged cheering). VOTES OF THANKS. Mr W. A. Darbishire moved a vote of thanks to Professor Foster for his valuable address. He trusted that the female students would take an active interest in the study of biology, at all events a little more than they did in his young time, when the chief physiological knowledge of young ladies consistad in the glance of Ian eye and a, knowledge of the feelings of a man's heart which was all they really cared about (laughter). Mr Darbishire also included in his vote the name of the Principal and others.\u2014Professor Phillips seconded the resolution.\u2014In response Professor Foster said the address had been acting upon him as a sort of nightmare, and he had almost wished he had not undertaken the duty, but now it was .over, he was glad to be with them.-Principal Reichel then proposed and Dr Dobbie seconded a vote of thanks to the visitors.-Dr Francis Darwin in responding said the last time he was a visitor in that building, was when he was a bashful little boy, and the building a large hotel (laughter). He could but urge upon the College Council now the necessity for a botanical laboratory as absolutely necessary for the wider study of biology. They have pure air and excellent light which were considerations of great value.\u2014Professor Foster then formally declared the laboratories open, and the company were permitted to view the whole building.",

I Proceedings in connection with the sixty- third annual meeting of the British Association began at Nottingham on Wednesday. The general committee met under the presidency of Sir Archibald Geikie, when the report was adopted. It was stated that the association financially was now in a much better position than during the past two years, there being a balance on the right side. A large number of members have arrived in Nottingham, including several Contiuental scientists of distinction. Bournemouth and Ipswich have sent deputations inviting the association to visit those towns in 1895. In the evening Professor J. S. Burdon-Sandcr- son, M.A., LL.D., Ac., delivered his presi- dential address. He paid a tribute to the influence exerted during the past half-century by the British Association, and pleaded elo- quently for adequate Government recognition of the claims of science. Proceeding to address tho meeting on the nature and history of biology, the professor stated that the term -ko?n till ffe? the beginning of the present century, and went on to refer in a special manner to the first philosopher to employ the term, Treviranus, whose labours were next succinctly alluded to. To Treviranus we owe the first scientific con- ception of the science of life as a whole, and this conception could in the present state of knowledge still be accepted as true.

The audience at the delivery of the President'* address, in the Exinbtiori Palace, was large, up to 2,000, and the scene brilliant. The president's voice was hardly sufficient for the great hall. He was accompanied by Sir C. W. Thompson, Col..Humaby, i\u00bb.Ir H. M. Stanley, and other guests. The Lord Mayor filled the ohan. The address dwelt in the first instance upon the purposes and prospects of the British Association, and then proceeded to consider the external aspects and tendencies of mathematical science. He said that of .11) presidents of the association, 20 had passed away, while the remainder held im- portant positions in science and in the public ser- vice. The question of limitation in the range of mathematics was, as a subject matter fortheprexi- dential address, net so simple as might appear. While, on the one hand, knowledge was distinct from opinion, from feeling, and from all other modes of subjective impression, still the limits of knowledge were at all times expanding, and the unknown was never rigidly or permanently fixed. Our ignorance consisted in the ignorance of actual facts, and partly also in the ignorance of possible raugo of ascertainable facts. Although in its technical character mathematical science suffered the inconveniences, while it enjoyed the dignity of Olympian position, still in a less formal garb, or in disguise, it was found present at many an unexpected turn. Mathematics would carry them to limits of problems which she specially under- takes, but beyond that she was imputurbaWy silent. The sectional meeting of the British Association, now holding its 48th session in Dublin, commenced on Thursday. Several highly-interesting papers were read to large audiences, The main feature iii the day's proceedings was Sir C. Wvville Thomsons' address at the geography section, in which he dealt with the brilliant results of Mr Stanley's African expedition, referring to Arctic and other explorations. He declared that their result had been to give us an improved idea of the physical condition of the ocean. Two facts especially,'being made clear in the first place/there there was a deposit of a chalky character con- stantly going on some few hundred miles srway from land, and secondly, that the occan averaged 2,000 fathoms in depth, and nowhere exceeded 5,000. Papers were\" 'also read by Professor Houghton on mathematical and physical science, Mr John Evans on geology, Professor W. H. Fowler on biology, Dr Ingram on economic science and statistics', and Mr Edward Easton on mechanical science.' The O'Donnell will give an address in the biology department, and Professor Huxley will read a paper on anatomy.",

Though ridiculed by sceptics and despised, by the ignorant, who will not be con' vinced, even should experiments establish an empi- lical tiuth in the very teeth of their convictions, yet to the scholar\u2014to the earnest seeker after the true to the patient watcher of the hidden arcana of nature, there is much, very much, in this science, that is worthy of the most- profound consideration. Its most earnest advoeat-es assume that it has the power of unfolding in the young faculties which if allswed to expand, would develop a light which should shins a star of the greatest- magnitude in the human firmament, offering a key to unlock the mystery so beautifully expressed by the poet Gray:\u2014 Full many a gem of purest ray serene, The dark uufatliomed caves of ocean bear; I ull many a flower is born to blusli unseen, And waste its fragrance oa the desert air.\" Tnis science numbers among its priestesses a young lady of handsome exterior, of fasAnating manners, and of cultivated intellect, in the person of Miss James, who has the whole of this week delighted the audieftces, which have crowded every evening to witness the extraordinary power and control she has manifested over those subject t-o her influence. After witnessing several entertainments of the same class, characterized as they have been by great vulgarity and coarseness, it is a delightful treat to spend an evening with Miss James, where the most fastidious and refined would be most satisfactorily gratified, and the student of nature supplied with pabulum of the most interesting kind for future re- flection. It IS very satisfactory to observe that Mr. James endeavoured to impress upon the audience the practical character of the evening's proceedings;, showing the importance of mesmerism in its bear- ings on the character, thus giving a permanent value to an evening's amusement, which might otherwise have been lost. To those who affect to condemn the facts connected yvith mesmerism and electro biology, simply because they are mesmeric, and therefore un- worthy of credence, we would only say, with the gentle Shakspere, There are more things in heaven and in earth, Horatio- Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.",

                "full_text": "A MEDICAL SCHOOL FOR CARDIFF, la a memorandum which Dr Isambard Owen has prepared on the projected foundation of a medical school for Cardiff, the follow- ing occurs :\u2014\" It certainly appears to me that a great opportunity lies before Cardiff in the proposal to found a School of Medicine. Medical education in this country is by no means on a satisfactory footing. The students re- quirements are twofeld. In the first place he needs a sound academic training in the contributory sciences of physics, chemistry, biology, histology, physiology, and human anatomy. In the second ,lace he requires a wide field of clinical observa- ion in which to prosecute hi\", more strictly medi- cal studies. What Cambridge and Oxford have done for medical education, Cardiff may also do. The University College at present affords a full training in physics, chemistry, and biology. The infirmary, of 120 beds, is nearly the equivalent of Addenbrooke's Hospital, and has a much more important clinical field to draw upon. If a chair ot human anatomy and one of physiology and histology can be added te the college, and some provision made for instruction in materia medica, there is nothing to hinder Cardiff from carrying on, as the old universities do, the education of medical students in a thoroughly effectual manner up to the point of the first M.B. examination of the London University or the primary examina- tion of the conjoint board. If thi\u00bb can be done it will be a service, not only in Wales, but to medical education generally. Student life in a populous town necessarily offers many temptations to young men at the age at which medical studies are usually commenced. This evil is at its maximum when the student fiuds himself an unknown stranger in a distant city, among unfamiliar surroundings it is minimised when he is within reach of the restraining influences of relatives, friends, and home associations. I can wall understand that many a parent in South Wales would be glad for his son to commence his studies in a town where such influences may be available, and to proceed to tho metropolis at a later age, when some experience of life has baen obtained and the character is more firmly estab- lished.\"",

MR CHAMBERLAIN AND THE SCREW TRADE.\u2014 A Welsh correspondent has sent a copy of a speech by Sir Watkin Wynn, M.P., to Mr Chamberlain, containing the following allusion to the right hon. gentleman :\u2014\"There is a Birmingham Liberal, one of the members there, who is a great man, a very great Liberal, whose liberality consisted a few years ago as a maker of screws and bolts in going round to the smaller people and offering them a small amount of money to close their works, and if they did not then, said, \"I will break you.\" Two or three who re- fused to do it they broke. Mr Chamberlain replies If \u00cf1 Watkin Wynn intended to refer to me I have only to say that his statement is absolutely false. I may add that I have just compelled another Tory speaker, who put the same statement in rather more definite language, to sign a full apology and to pay legal expenses. \"\u2014Yours truly, J. CHAMBERLAIN. LEICESTER AND ABERYSTWYTH COLLEGE. \u2014 A meeting of the Welsh residents of Leicester was converted by circular at St. Nicholas Vicarage, Leices- ter, oa Wednesday evening, the loth July. The purpose of the meeting was to consider the desirability of rendering some assistance to Aberystwyth college, in consequence of the loss sustained by the recent disastrous fire. The cause was warmly taken up by those present. A committee was formed, and a subscription list opened- It was decided to canvass the Welsh residents, and. a hope was expressed that other English towns would follow this good example. Much sympathy was shewn for the loss sustained, and especially for the loss of life. The Welsh community in Leicester is only a small one, but already \u00a38 has been promised towards the object of restoration or re- building. The following gentlemen with power to add to their number were placed on the committee\u2014The f.ev T, W. Owen, vicar of St. Nicholas, Messrs E.

PROVINCIAL MAYORS AT THE MANSION HOUSE.\u2014 The Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress entertained the mayors and provosts of the United Kingdom on Tues- day evening at a ball given at the Mansion House, T'he guests were altogether about one thousand in number and included representatives of 115 English, 4 Irish and 11 Scotch cities and towns, as well as the Aldermen and Common Council of the City of London. Mr John James, Mayor of Aberystwith was present. The Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress were accompanied by the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex, and were attended by the Sword and Mace Bearers. Dancing began in the Egyptian Hall at half-past nine 0' clock and was continued till a late hour; supper being served in the old ball-room. The recption-room and ball-room were brilliantly lighted by electricity. The band of the Honourable Artillery Company was in attendance, and played under the direction of Signor Tamplini. RISE IN LEAD.\u2014English pig lead has been sold this week at \u00a313 per ton. The quotation of JE12 10s., which has been current, is thus below the mark. During the past three or four months the progress of lead has been upward, though gradual. It has been worthy of note that each rise has been well maintained. The advance once having taken place there has been scarcely any decline. Various causes have contributed to raise the price from \u00a39, which was about the lowest quotation, to wnich so far has been the highest. The princi- pal has been the closing of many mines in Spain, Ger- many, and the United States. In the latter country alone the decreased production is variously stated at between 2-5,000 and 30,000 tons. The apprehension of war with Russia has led the Government to make pur- chases and manufacturers to lay in stocks, of which they were wholly bereft by the hand-to-mouth system upon which they have been buying. There is also some fear on the part of purchasers lest the Spanish pprts should be closed by reason of the cholera, and hence there is on all sides an eagerness to secure stocks which has not been observable for several years past. The deepe8 depth of the lead trade was perhaps reached when Tankervillc sold a parcel of lead ore exactly twelve months at 15s. Rom in Gravels has just sold a parcel at \u00a38 (j. rise of f2 lis. 3d. per ton. This same ore in 1873 was sold at \u00a317 10s., so that the margin for a further rise is still very great. There arc but few lead mines that have survived the storm of the last few years, and we are of opinion that by acting in concert they might obtain a further ad- vance. So long as they continue apart, like the hairs upon the back of an electrifieu cat, so long wil they be at the mercy of the buyers. Only by combination can lead producers secure a fair price for their ore. Where is the leader of such a movement ? The hour has come but where is the man ?\u2014Mining World. NORTH WALES BLACK CATTLE SOCIETY.\u2014A meeting of the Editorial Committee was held at the Council Room of the Royal Agricultural Society of England at Preston, on Wednesday, the Right Hon. Lord Harlech presiding. A proof of the second volume of the Herd Book was revised, when several corrections and addi- tions were made. Mr. Smith, of Tynewydd, Bangor, and the honorary secretary. Mr. W. Dew, of Bryn Bras Castle, Carnarvon, were appointed to inspect the stock objected to in this Herd Book. The following resolu- tion was unanimously agreed to (the Earl of Cawdor, representing the South Wales Black Cattle Society, being present) That the red smoky-faced cattle are not the recognizptlnatiollal Welsh breed, and are not eligible for entry in either of the Welsh Herd Books, and that a protest be sent to the R.A.S.E. agaiust exhibits 670 and G76 in classes 70 and 71.\" Mr. W. A. Dew, of Bangor, as secretary pro. tem., and Mr. John Jones, of Llandudno, attended the committee on behalf of the proposed Welsh Cattle Show to be held in connection with the Liverpool and Manchester Show, which is fixed tor Chester in 1886, desiring that the Society should offer special prizes for black Welsh cattle to be exhibited at that show. The committee were given to understand that the Manchester and Liverpool Show Committee, and the Chester Town Council, and several local societies would liberally sup- port them. Tije committee unanimously agreed to re- commend the general meeting to be held at Bangor on the 16th of September next. the day of the Anglesey and Carnarvonshire Show, to offer special prizes for black Welsh cattle, when also the question of amalga- mating the North and South Wales Cattle Societies will be discussed.",

                "full_text": "A MEETING CALLED IN LONDON. Lord Abordare's interest in the University College, Cardiff, is ever alive, and his influence may be easily gathered from the fact that a meeting in furtherance of the proposal to establish a department of medical sciences, or school of medicine, at the college is to be held under the presidency of his lordship, at the house of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, 20, Hanover-square, London, on Wednesday next. In a memorandum which Dr Isambard Owen has prepared on the projected foundation, the follow- ing occurs:\u2014\"Itcertainly appoars to me that a great opportunity lies before Cardiff in tbe proposal to found a School of Medicine. Medical education in this country is by no mean3 on a satisfactory footing. The students re- quirements are twofold. In the first place ho needs a sound academic training in the contributory sciences of physics, chemistry, biology, histology, physiology, and human anatomy. In the second place be requires a wide field of clinical observa- tion in which to prosecute his more strictly medi- cal studies. What Cambridge and Oxford have done for medical education, Cardiff may also do. The University College at present affords a full training in physics, chemistry, and biology. The infirmary, of 120 beds, is nearly the equivalent of Addenbrooke's Hospital, and has a much more important chmcal field to draw upon. If a chair of human anatomy and one of physiology aud histology can be added to the college, and some provision made for instruction in materia medica, thore is nothing to hinder Cardiff from carrying on, as the old universities do, the education of medical students in a thoroughly effectual manner up to the point of the first M.B. examination of the London University or the primary examina- tion of the conjoint board. If this can be done it will be a service, not only to Wales, but to medical education generally. Student life in a populous town necesearily offers many temptations to young men at the age at which medical studies are usually commenced. This evil is at iCe maximum when the student finds himself an unknown stranger in a distant city, among unfamiliar surroundings it is minimisad when be is within reach of the restraining influences of relatives, friends, and home associations. I can woll understand that many a parent in South Wales would be glad for his son to commence bis studies in a town where such influences may be avadable, and to proceed to tho metropolis at a later ago, when some experience of life has baen obtained and the character is more firmly estab- lished.\"",

In the anthropological section the first paper was by Sir Charles Wilson, who gave a detailed account of various tribes in the Soudan from notes made during the campaign there. These tribes had never been properly studied. It was curious to note how the tribes had, while absorbing Arab conquerors, lost their own nationality. The mathematical and physical science and biology sections united to consider the question of colour vision. It Lord Rayleigh iniated the discussion o n the question of colour vision, treating of various theories as to primary colours, and pointing out that what we called colour blindness was really not so, persons so affected being able to distinguish two or three colours only. Dr. Arthur Konig (Berlin), Professor Foster and Mr J. Tennant, also took part in the discussion. In the Economics and Statistics Section, Miss W. L. Hall advocated the boarding out of children as a means of checking pauperism.",

The West Riding Chambers of Agriculture have recently had the subject of agricultural education under consideration, and with a view to the better understanding- of the plans of the Science and Art Department, Mr. Buckmaster has held meetings in several agricultural centres in Yorkshire, for the purpose of discussing the subject. The opinion is very general that the time has come when some- thing ought to be done. A scientific knowledge of agriculture, says Mr. Buckmaster, can only be gained by observation and experiment. Why is agriculture to be regarded as an exception to every other industry? Will any one venture to say that it is a business re- quiring less scientific knowledge than weaving or mining ? Geology, botany, biology, meteorology, and chemistry are all interwoven with the daily life of a farmer; and rightly understood, it is the most thoughtful and intellectual of occupations. Every farmer should believe and remember that in the edu- cation of his sons science lays the foundation of every- thing valuable in agriculture, and those who were really in earnest could render no better or more per- manent service than by promoting night classes for teaching the scientific principles of agriculture.",

They met at ten o'clock at the Lodge, after which they marched to Bryncleivion and the Rectory at Mallwyd. They then went to Dinas, and called at the Plas. The \u00a1 Cemmaes brass band played lively airs. After parading, \u00a1 they repaired to the Buckley Arms Hotel, where a good dinner had been provided (in the usual good style by the Host and Hostess), to which the members did justice;. The day was rather unfavourable, but the members mustered strong and the appearance was imposing with the banners and regalia. The balance sheet shows that the funds are favourable. EDUCATION\u2014We observe the name of Mr. E. Hughea, science teacher, placed in the first class at the course of lectures and practical work in biology, given by Professor Huxley at the South Kensington Museum to successful teachers. Mr. Hughes also took a first-class advanced stage in physics at the late annual examination.

The hotel contains eleven large lofty, well-lighted rooms, which will be amplify sufficient to well accommodate all the arts classes. The whole south wing of the college, which was untouched by the fire, will thus become available for the science department. The large room on the ground floor which was formerly the examination and dining hall will give a chemical laboratory 36 feet by 25 feet, a lecture room 24 feet by 26 feet, a physical laboratory 24 feet by 26 feet, and good accommodation for biology, all well lighted, lofty rooms. The laboratories will be well fitted with all appliances necessary for prac- tical scientific work. This temporary arrange ment will thus give considerably superior accom modation in all departments to that which the college possessed before the fire.

In his own country Professor Virchow enjoys a far wider reputation, as being also a distinguished archaeologist, an anthropologist, a social re- former, and even (malgre lui, one would think) an effective and bitter parliamentary debater. It was with his researches in pathology, however, and the position of pathology among the biological studies,\" that he dealt on Thursday last. Tracing the history of medicine down from the earliest times, he stopped at Hunter, who, with the instruments at his disposal, was enabled to trace structural development right down to the 9 ovum, which, accordingly, he regarded as the ultimate seat of life, disease, and death. Omne ovum ab ovo was Hunter's creed; but Virchow's work began where Hunter's ended. He could see structure in an ovum without difficulty, and by means of long and patient investigation had finally reduced all life, vegetable as well as animal, to the common basis of cellular generation. The science j has reached its limit at omnis cettula a cellula.",

MORGAN, of the Technical Institute and South Wales School of Chemistry, Nelson-street, Swansea, recently applied to the examining Board of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons that his Institute should be recognised as a place of instruction in chemistry, physics, and practical chemistry for the examinations which are held under the Examining Board. This has been granted, and Dr. Morgan's well-known and admir- ably-conducted Institute in Nelson-street is registered under the Examining Board of the two important medical colleges mentioned above. These Royal Colleges have also adopted another recommendation of the com- mittee, viz., that students be admitted to examination in chemistry, physics, and practical chemistry, before registration as medical students. These are important edu- cational concessions, such as ought to prove of much good in the furtherance of technical education in South Wales. Dr. Morgan intends next year to add biology to his curriculum.",

I L Anti-Aiienisfce is the title of a remarkable and amusing little sheet written and produced by the patients they would no doubt strongly object I to be called lunatics-of the great Bicetre Asylum, Its editor-in-chief is one Charles Etlinger, and its price the same as The Times. It circulation is limited, forty copies being as large an edition as can be produced by the gehttme process. Politics and religion find no place in it, but it excels in satire, directed mainly against the doctors. Its prose is not one whit more incoherent than than that of the boulevards. Serious discussions are not tabooed. A propos of a communication by Dr. Charles I1 ere to the Society of Biology,relative to the transmission of madness from men to animals, Etlinger, in a recent number, inveighs against the protniscuousness in asylums which allows the exchange of all sorts of madness j between man and man. He demands what amount of reason it is necessary to possess to resist a prolonged stay in an asylum like Bieetre, where j the iron cages converge towards a common centre, and where the raving madmen disturb their more I paacefuljieighbours.",

The committee would prefer the first subject. In order to ensure the popularity of the lectures by pro- curing a good attendance, it has been decided to fix the fees as low as 5s. per term but, as a number of people have intimated their intention of subscribing\u2014some two guineas, some a guinea, isc., the funds will be helped, and the subscribers will receive an equivalent in the shape of tickets to the amount they give.

The room was densely crowded by an audience whose risibility was thoroughly developed by the ridiculous performances of a number of young men, who went upon the platform at the request of the young lady, and over whom she ap- peared to have perfect influence while in a state of mes- merism. At the close of the divertissement some prizes were distributed, amongst which was a silver watch, which fell to the lot of a young woman residing in this town, named Caroline Evans. The entertainment was to be repeated on the two following evenings. It is source of much regret that there is no room in the place into which concerts, lectures, and entertainments of all kinds could be introduced, and it in, perhaps, owing to this fact, that we so seldom have the chance of a few hours diversion. If there was a suitable rocm in the place many people who object to visiting public-houses would then feel a pleasure in attending, in order to obtain a couple of hours recreation.",

The annual presentation of prizes in connec- tion with the University College of South Wales, which took place at the Park Hall, Cardiff, on Wednesday afternoon last, is pecu- liarly interesting to the Birry district in more than one sense, for, in addition to the fact that Lord Windsor, the chairman of the Barry Company, occupied the position of president on the occasion, one of the principal prize takers in music was Miss Amy Jane Lewis, of Barry, between whom and Miss Kittv Davies, of Cardiff (a popular member of Mr Jacob Davies' celebrated choir) first honours were divided both in advanced and intermediate harmony. The occasion was one which also afforded general interest in an equally peculiar sense, for, in scanning the list of prizetakers, we find that a considerable proportion of the successful students consisted of members of the gentle sex, the highest awards in Greek, Latin, mathematics, psychology, ethics, logic, biology, French, German, music, and other classes being secured by young ladies from different parts of England and South Wales, who had specially prepared themselves for the examination. We heartily congratulate these fair students upon the signal triumph they have thus accomplished in the difficult spheres of higher education, and we hope the day is not far distant when educated women can be placed side by side with educated men, and take their place, if necessary, in the body politic as well as discharge their natural functions in the important sphere of domestic usefulness.",

The West Riding Chambers of Agriculture have recently had the subject of agricultural education under consideration, and with a view to the better understanding of the plans of the Science and Art Department, Mr. Buckmaster has held meetings in several agricultural centres in Yorkshire, for the purpose of discussing the subject. The opinion is very general that the time has come when some- thing ought to be done. A scientific knowledge of agriculture, says Mr. Buckmaster, can only be gained by observation and experiment. Why is agriculture to be regarded as an exception to every other industry? Will any one venture to say that it is a business re- quiring less scientific knowledge than weaving or mining ? Geology, botany, biology, meteorology, and chemistry are all interwoven with the daily life of a farmer; and rightly understood, it is the most thoughtful and intellectual of occupations. Every farmer should believe and remember that in the edu- cation of his sons science lays the foundation of every- thing valuable in agriculture, and those who were really in earnest could render no better or more per- manent service than by promoting night classes for teaching the scientific principles of agriculture.",

The dredging and sounding operations are already regarded as of the utmost value in all that concerns ocean currents and the biology of the sea in the existing and in past epochs. The collection of specimens is very extensive. Some of these have been sent home, while a considerable number still remain on board. The Challenger left Spithead Dec. 21, 1872, Captain Nares being then in command. On his appointment to the command of the Arctic EipAlition he was succeded by Captain Thomson. The total dis- tances run have been as follows: First year, 19,367 miles; second year, 17,158 miles; third year, 18,824 miles; fourth year, 12,835 miles-making a total of 68,184 miles; 4716 tons of coal have been consumed during the voyage.",

The programme (which was not too lengthy) consisted of choice and well selected pieces. The attendance (considering it was the first meeting, and not having been made public enough) was good and respectable but the character of these readings deserves a better and more numerous audience, which we hope to see in future. MESMERISM.\u2014Mr. H. Box Brown gave six interesting entertainments in Mesmerism and Electro-Biology, at the British school-room. The attendance at his several entertainments, was on the whole good, and the proceed- ings gave great satisfaction. Mr. Brown distributed presents at every meeting; a silver watch was given away on Saturday evening, the 5th inst., which was won by a man from Treorki, a silver teapot on Monday evening, was won by a man from the neighbourhood a great many less valuable presents were given away every evening.",

                "full_text": "DRUNKENNESS AND HEREDITY. Are the children of drunkards more likely to become drunkards by virtue of heredity ? This question has been investigated by a scientific committee at the instance of the Society for the Study of Inebriety. Most persons would reply without hesitation that the drinker's child, even though he never knew his parent, would doubt- less in most cases inherit the alcoholic taint. But most persons are unaware of the fact that, as the Lancet puts it The last word of science, as declared by teachers of physiology, biology, and botany, makes the definite assertion that no instance of an acquired characteristic has ever been demonstrated in either the animal or vegetable kingdom.\" Many eminent men, including Mr Herbert Spencer, believe in use- inheritance, and the public generally do so but the leading authorities are opposed to it. The Inebriety Committee find that inebriety is not hereditary, but that a tendency to it is heritable; and that the frequent succession of alcoholism in a family suggests taint. The latter circum- stance, however, may be explained by evil environment and by debilitated constitutions, about which there is no question. It is a pleasant theory that drunkenness tends of itself to weed out the unfit, but confessedly the process is rather slow.",

One of the largest and most complete of modern educational institutions in the North of England, the 'Yorkshire College, which is situated at Leeds, and was opeued by the Prince of Wales in July last, was on Monday evening the scene of consider- able excitement and alarm, in consequence of a hre breaking out in the roof of that portion of tne building in which is situated the chemistry lecture hail and the section devoted to the study ot biology, it appears that one of the two sunlights with which the chemistry lecture-hall is lighted had been burning the greater part of the day, and that the heat from this apparatus had set fire to the false Scoring which separates the hall from the biological eeetioo above. When the hre was discovered shortly after nine o'clock, one of the professors was lecturing to a large audience in the chemistry lecture hall. The lecture was brought to an abrupt conclusion, and though it was feared that a panic might ensue, the large audience left the ball iu an orderly manner. The corporation brig<tde was soon on the spot, and the tire w&a got under at one o'clock in the morn- ing. The damage, chiefly caused by water, will be covered by insurance, but the inc'n- \\ec'<nce and loss of time caused to students wiU be very considerable.",

Dr Jean Damysz, director of the Labora- tory of Agricultural Micro-Biology, at the Pasteur Institute, Paris, whose name is identified with a well-known remedy against the depredatibns of rats and mice, has just made a discovery of interest to adl- lovers of cats. Every winter for some years past therfe has been a serious epidemic amongst oats in the department of Eure, Normandy which proved particularly dea\u00f9fl to kittens. Last February, a large number of oarts suc- cumbed to the disease after only a. few days illness. One of the victims w,as despatched to Dr Danysz laboratory in Paris, and an autopsy was performed. This enabled Dr Danysiz to produce and cultivate the microbe of the mysterious disease). Later, he pro- duced a serum, as an anti-toxin, renders \"puss\" entirely immune to the dreaded malady. A treatise on the subject of thic, latest scientific discovery is included in a recent number of the \"Annales de L'lnstitut Pasteur.\"",

Every winter for some years past there has been a serious epidemic amongst cats in the Department of Eure in Normandy, which proved particularly deaoiy to kittens. Last February, a large number of cats succumbed to the disease after only a few days' illness. One of the victims was despatched to Dr. Danysz' Laboratory in Paris, and an auiopsy was performed. This enabled Dr. Danysz to produce and cultivate the microbe of the mysterious disease. Later, he produced a s< rum which, as an anti-toxin, renders \"puss\" entirely immune to the dreaded malady. A treatise OD the subject of this latest scientific discovery is included in a recent number of the \"Annilea de L'lnstitut. Pasteur.\"",

Professor Ray Lankester, F.R.S., gave the first of four lectures at the Royal Institution on Tuesday, taking as his subject, Thirty Years' Progress in Biology.\" He referred to the baseless attack of M. Brunetiere, of the Revue des Detix Mondes, upon science, and declared that it was only to the im- patient and ignorant that the phrase bankruptcy of science could appear to have even the smallest justification. Biological science had never proposed to do more than to ascertain the order of nature, including man's nature, and had steadily ad- vanced, and, indeed, made wonderful dis- coveries in the past 30 years. The first of these to which he drew attention was the increase of our knowledge as to the living sub- stance of plants and animals called protoplasm. Protoplasm occurs either as single or connected cor- puscles called cells,\" each provided with a nucleus, or peculiar central body. Attention was first drawn to the discovery that the protoplasmic cells of plants are not each isolated and boxed in by a dense cell- wall, as once supposed, but that the living substance is continuous from cell to cell by means of fine threads. The foam-like or emulsion structure of protoplasm was described, and then the recent dis- coveries as to the importance of the nucleus. The part played by the nucleus in the fertilization of the egg by the spermatozoon was specially described and illustrated by numerous large wall diagrams.",

Professor Lant Carpenter was found on Wed- nesday morning shot dead in his bedroom, at 36, Craven-park, Willesden. A discharged revolver lay by his side. The deceased was prominently identified with the educational and philanthropic institutions of the Willesden neighbourhood and the metropolis generally. He was a well-known lecturer on scientific subjects, particularly to audi- eeces at the Victoria Coffee Music-hall. He was a clear, incisive speaker, and had great power of illustration, being able to make the driest subjects of interest to his audiences. He was at one time engaged in manufacture, and afterwards joined the London School Board. He became pro- foundly interested in the population question, on which he held very strong views, A lecture which he delivered upcn that subject at Willis's Rooms, in tho summer of 1889, before a large audience, chiefly composed of clergymen and doctors, crcated a vast amount of attention. He condemned in unmeasured term the great rate at which the population was increasing, and railed at the doctors and clergymen for the part they had taken in encouraging rather than in checking it. Personally he was of very placid temperament. He was not really a professor, although he was often dubbed such owing to his being so great an authority on biology and other scientific subjects. He was the son of Dr. Carpenter, and was a married man and about 60 years of age.",

During the earlier part of the proceedings of this sitting there was a larger attendance of mem- bers than at any time since the delivery of the presidential address. The first paper read was one by Prof. Krause on \"Anatomical Nomenclature, which was discussed by Dr Traquair and Mr George Murray. The latter pointed out that anatomists, morphologists, and patholo- gists could never attain a perfect system of nomenclature until they adopted a system like the Decandollean laws of botanical nomenclature. He was followed by Prof. Howes. -Prof. Marcus Hartvey read a paper on Fertilization and Conjugaticn Processes as Modes of Rejuven- escence. The recent investigations of the Marine Biological Association formed the subject of an interesting paper, read by Mr W. L. Oalderwood, who also read Mr J. T. Cunning- ham's paper, which dealt with the growth of food frolus, and the distribution of their young. Towards the close of the sitting the papers read were mostly of a zoological character. The president, Mr Francis Darwin, then vacated the chair in favour of Dr Traquair. In the meantime the audience had dwindled down to about eight persons, and the remaining papers. all of which were by Mr J. T. Cunningham, and which dealt with The Reproduction of the Pilchard,\" Observations on the Larvas of Pal- inurus,\" and \"TheDistribution ofCrystallagobius nilsonii\" evoked but little discussion.",

A victim of the same kind of mania, but in a much greater degree, was presented at the last meeting of the Paris Society of Biology by a member, M. Magnan. A degenerate aritho- maniac is what the unfortunate man is called by the learned. He is the slave of the figure 3. In order to avert some terrible misfortune conjured up by his brain, he feels compelled at all times to group by series of threes all his acts, and all the things and events which concern him. If he has a toothache, he goes and has three teeth pulled out. The other day he purloined, at one of the open shops called bazaars, three corkscrews, and having pocketed them, he crossed three streets and threw the three corkscrews into the third sewer grating he came across.",

Last year, he said, 20,000 bottles, worth F-1,100, were returned to manufacturers through the bottle exchanges. The Council decided to burn the refuse. Professor Hewlett Quick, professor of biology- at Cambridge, delivered an address at the Royal Institute of Public Health on the im- portance of a pure milk supply. He said there were in round numbers 4,000,000 cows, yielding, from seventeen to eighteen hundred million gallons of milk per annum in this country. The value of it mi,rht be taken at 9115,000,060. Among the competitors in an open sheep- shearing competition at Marldon, near Paign- ton, was James Saunders, who is in his eighty- second year. He has been shearing for sixty- nine years, and his work in the competition bore very favourable comparison with that oi younger men.. For stealing 65,000 soap wrappers belonging to Messrs. Lever Brothers, Port Sunlight, James Walter Kinnish, an employee, was, at Birkenhead, sentenced to six months' imprison- ment. A Peterborough dealer was said to have bought the wrappers, which were sent in prizes, for 14s. per 1,000.",

The West Riding Chambers of Agriculture have recently had the subject of agricultural education under consideration, and with a view to the better understanding of the plans of the Scienee and Art Department, Mr. Buckmaster has held meetings in several agricultural centres in Yorkshire, for the purpose of discussing the subject. The opinion is very general that the time has come when some- thing ought to be dene. A scientific knowledge of agriculture, says Mr. Buckmaster, can only be gained by observation and experiment. Why is agriculture to be regarded as an exception to every other industry? Will any one venture to say that it is a business re- quiring less scientific knowledge than weaving or mining? Geology, botany, biology, meteorology, and chemistry are all interwoven with the daily life of a farmer; and rightly understood, it is the most thoughtful and intellectual of occupations. Every farmer should believe and remember that in the edu- cation of his sons science lays the foundation of every- thing valuable in agriculture, and those who were really in earnest could render no better or more per- manent service than by promoting night classes for teaching the scientific principles of agriculture.",

My eldest son was at a, well-known, old-established, and good Grammar School in England; but although pains- taking and anxious to do his best, he formed no de- cided taste for any of the subjects taught there. I removed him to the University College of Wales, where. he attended the lectures of Mr Parker (now Professor at Cardiff) on biology and botany, and worked in Dr Humpidge's laboratories. These studies completely absorbed him, and the boy was very happy. Eighteen months ago he left to go to theRoyal College of Veterinary Surgeons, London, and I was gratified to learn last July that he stood second in his year. I am sure he would not have done equally well from any school in Great Britian.",

The Right Rev. John Wale Hicks was a model Colonial bishop, and a remark- able man in every respect. His know- ledge of medicine was only second to that of theology. He was a graduate of London and Cambridge, and was a Doctor of Medi- cine of the former and a Doctor of Divinity of the latter uuiversity, a record which is probably unique in ecclesiastical circles. He was a Gold Medallist of London in O'isie'ric J.f dicine, and was as much an authority in such branches as chemistry, biology, and geology, as in logic, moral plplosophy. and paleontology. Previous to his consecration he had had a brilliant career in connection with education, science, and the Church, and seven years ago he decided to place his unrivalled quali- fications at the service of religion in South Africa, his vast diocese comprising the Orange Free State, Griqualand West, Basutoland, and Beehuanaland. He left England a strong man, but hard work, in- cessant labour and care, coupled with the effects of the South African climate, told upon his health, with the result we now know.",

One of the largest and most complete of modern educational institutions in the North of England, the Yorkshire College, which is situated at Leeds, and was opened by the Prince of Wales in July last, was on Monday evening the scene of consider- able excitement and alarm, in consequence of a tire breaking out in the roof at that portion of the building in which is situated the chemistry lecture hall and the section devoted to the study of biology. It appears that one of the two sunlights with which the chemistry lecture-hall is lighted had been burning the greater part of the day, and that the heat from this apparatus had set lire to the false flooring which sep\"rates the hall lrom the biological section above. When the tire was discovered shortly after nine o'clock, one of the professors was lecturing to a large audience in the chemistry lecture ball. The lecture was brought to an ubrupt conclusion, and though it was teared that a panic mig-ht ensue, the large audience left the ball in an orderly manner. The corporation brigade was soon on the spot, and the fire was got under at one o'clock in the morn- ing. The damage, chiefly caused by water, will be covered by insurance, but the incon- venience and loss of time caused to students will be very considerable.",

TO THE EDITOR OF THE\" WEEKLY MAIL.\" SIR,\u2014Allow me to give my experience on the point raised in Professor Genesis fifth argument against the unreasonable regulations proposed by the head-masters of Welsh schools. My eldest son was at a well-known, old-established, and good Grammar School in England but, although pains- taking and anxious to do his best, he formed no dccided taste for any of the subjects taught there. I removed him to the University College of Wales, where he attended the lectures of Mr. Parker (now Professor at Cardiff) on biology and botany, and worked in Dr. Hutnpidge's laboratories. These studies completely absorbed him, and the boy was very happy. Eighteen months ago hn left to go to the Royal College ot Veterinary Surgeons, London, and I was gratified to learn last July that he stood se ond in his vear. I am sure he would not have do Ie equally well from any school in Great Britain. \u2014. am, &c., J. ROBERTS. Gogerddan Arms Hotel, Aberystwith.",

The leading papers this morning include one by Lord Kelvin on the \"Stability of periodic motion,\" and one by Professor Marshall Ward on the Chemical aspects of bacteriology.\" The Prince of Monaco discourses upon the \"Currents of the Nortti Atlantic.\" In the biology section on Monday there is to be a meeting of the whole section to discuss Sea Fisheries.\" Pap r by the Prince of Monaco. The Prince of Monaco had a large and fashion- able audience for his account of the meteorological observations in the Atlantic Oc<?an. He spoke with distinct enunciation in good English. He admitted that American storm warnings were of great value, but the width of the Atlantic was so great that American storms lost, themselves and others were generated of which Europaans could at present receive no warning. The Atlantic was fairly rich in islands suitable for meteorological observations, and he suggested that they should bs utilised. The results already achieved at the high level obser- vatory on Ben Nevis justified confident expecta- tions. Equaiiy and perhaps more valuable results would be attained by the establishment of a pair of high and low level laboratories in one of the Atlantic groups of islands, preferably the Azores.",

Dr. St. George Mivart, F.E.S., the distin- guished biologist, died somewhat suddenly :n London on Sunday, at the age of 72 years. Ho was a voluminous author and a scientific man of high standing, for some years filling the post of professor of biology at the university college, and afterwards that of professor of the philosophy of natural history at Louvain. A distinguished Roman Catholic apologist, he afterwards disagreed with that Church, and, refusing to recant, was excluded from its communion. The correspondence between the doctor and Cardinal Yaughan attracted grea.t attention some weeks since. [Dr. St. George Mivart did not long survive the controversy between himself and Cardinal Vaughatt. He was, without doubt, one of the ablest lay apologists tho Roman Catholic Church ever had in this country, and he had been for many years an unwearying controversialist. But in the eticl his scientific instincts proved too strong, and he expressed himself so decidedly towards certain points in the Roman Catholic creed that Cardinal Vaughan, as the head of the Roman Catholic Church in England, was compelled to place before him a confession of faith, refwKJ to sign which would result in his excommunication. Dr. Mivart refused, and he has now passed beyond the pains and penalties of any Church. No one doubts that the recent controversy will have, its effects on Romanism, even though it may not lead to an actual schism in these islands.-Ed. E. E.\")",

He stated that in the times of Elizabeth the country, owing to defective sanitation, was decimated by typhus, leprosy, malarial fevers, and dysentery. A goodly proportion of these peats had now been extinguished. There was, however, no absolute certainty that this immunity would be per- I manent unlets sanitary conditions were main- tained\u2014Professor Simpson spoke on the recru- descence of the plague in the East and its rela- tion to Europe. He explained that the 'plague had now attacked Portugal. Discoveries which I had recently been made for combating the disease, combined with the fact that the malady I travelled slowly, rendered the checking or mitigation of the outbreak -in Europe more hopeful than before.\u2014Professor Percy Frank- lanti (president in the section for physics, chefnistry, and biology) said England was well up in practical sanitation, but behind in sani- tary science The progress of science was quite as important for commercial purposes as national defences.\u2014The other subjects dis- cussed were the prevention of overcrowding the J luburban dwellings, with adequate facilitiee I for getting to them, the isolation of pulmonary \u2022sn^umj.tion, and purification.

The racing yesterday at Lingfleld was hardly worth looking at, and absolutely the only feature of general interest was the appearance of Mr. Horatio Bottomley's Grand National outsider. Biology, in the London and Brighton Handicap Steeplechase. The unsexed son of St. Hilaire was called upon to give lots of weight away all round, and as he was right in the fighting line at the last fence he must be held to have acquitted himself well.

Flor di Cuba won easily for Lord Wolverton, although, as at Birmingham, he fenced very badly. There will be no improvement in the character of the sport to-day, and, beyond suggesting that, even in the face of Miss Blucher, BARYTA represents good business for the Whyteleafe Selling Hurdle Handicap, I shall not attempt to comment on the pro- gramme.

The CIIAIIIJIAS, in opening the proceedings, said he had great pleasure in introducing to that large assembly Prctessor Michael Foster, who hud kindly come down to deliver au addrecs on the occasion of the opening cf their new biological laboratories (applause;, -inis was one of the great advantages that they derived in that neighbourhood from the University College, their having an oppor- tunity such as that, now and again of hearing ani seeing for themselves the great scientific men whose names lIere so fannliir tJ them loug before (applause). He was sure that they would agree with him that it was a privilege to hear and see Professor Foster. Before he called upon him, he understood that there wa, a deputation from the North Wales Medical Association to welcome the professor, and to present him with an address (applause). He now, therefore, called upon Dr. Lloyd Roberts, and the deputation to come forward to present Professor Foster with the address they had prepared (applause). The deputation having stepped forward, Dr. LLOYD ROBERTS said, as ths president of the North Wales branch of the British Medical Association, he begged to congratulate the Principal, and others connected witn tne University College, upon the success which had attended the inauguration of the institution\u2014(hear, bear)-,ind particularly on that occasion to congratulate him and others upon the inauguration of the biological department in that College (applause). A very natural sentiment had actuated ttie rnernbertl of their profession, and par; ticularly their Medical Association, to welcame one so distinguished in science as Professor Foster, and as such they had attended there as a deputation to present him with an address of welcome (applauee). tie would now call upon their secretary to read the Dr. R. JONES Mourns then read the subjoined adiress, which drew forth frequent applause on the part of the audience:- ?o PKOFEHSOR MrCIJAKL FOSTER, M.A., M.Dm LL,D., F?c, F U.S., UNIN LitSITY PbOFESSOR OF PHYSIOLOGY IS THR UNlVBKSITY OF CAMBttHME. We, the PresideutandCounoilof the North Wales branch of the British Medical Association, on be- half of our members, beg to offer to you, on the occasion of your visit to inaugurate the biological laboratory of the University College of North Wales, a most cordial welcome. We do So with more pleasure from the fact that you were at one time in your career, like ourselves, engaged in the oner- oid duties of a general practitioner, bit, animated by the promptiags of scientific genius, relinquished the more practical part of our profession, and devoted yourself to the prosecution of that science which underlies the practice of medicine and sur. gery, and is well named The Institute of Medicine.\" We congratulate the Council of this young and promising institution, not only on the establishment of a lecture hall and laboratory for furnishing its students with a theoretical and prac- tical knowledge of biological science, but P Iso that they have made such a happy selection in inviting so distinguished a physiologist as yourself to initiate its operations by delivering the opening address. Of the excellence of that choice we can speak in no measured terma. Your great services to the science of physiology are recognised and appreciated by the medical faculty throughout the world. We honour you, sir, as the careful painstaking investigator, the indefatigable student of the secrets of nature, the foremost physiological teacher in the British Isles, and the brilliant author of our standard work on physiology. In your capacity as Professor of Physi. ology in the University of Cambridge, you have so successfully laboured to obtain there for your students the means of original research and of pro- secuting the practical study of the sciences, and to establish upon a secure basis the reputation of that ancient seat of leariiing as a medical school, that its degrees in medicine now hold a position among the foremost and most coveted in the United Kingdom. Knowing, therefore, the prominent place you, who are the secretary of the Royal Society occupy amon\" the leaders of science, and the respect and esteem in which you are held by medical prac- tioners, we feel that we cannot allow the present opportunity to pass without expressing this senti- ment which now permeates the profession in North Wales We trust that you may long live to con- tinue your career of usefulness, and to enlighten and develop sail further the domain of physiology. -We have the honour to be your earnest well- wishers, J. LLOyn ROBERTS, M.B., president ;T. EYTON JONES, M.D., vice-president; R. ARTHUR PRICHARD ex-president; W. J ONES MORRIS, honorary secretary JOHN RICHARDS, honorary treasurer O. ELIAS OWEN, SAMUEL GRIFFITH, M.D., HUGH REES, ROBERT ROBERTS, CHARLES WILLIAMS, J. LLOYD Professor FOSTER, in acknowledging the compli- ment which had been paid him said lie felt deeply touched by the address which had just been read to him conveying as it did such cordial sentiments. The incident had been as unexpected as it had been pleas- ing (applause). During his life-long labours, he had, in his biological efforts had his professiou-as the address justly said he belonged to the medical pro- fession-in view; and he had endeavoured to aim at that which would be useful to his profes-ion (applause). As he should have occasion in the few remarks he intended to make subsequently to refer to the medical profession, they would excuse him saying more, but simply allow him to return his warmest thanks for the very cordial address (cheers). The CHAIRMAN said he had now the pleasure to call upon Professor Michael Foster to give his address in respect of the opeuing of the new labo- Professor FOSTER, in tbecourse of his remarks, said he imagined thttia being asked to say s me few words on that oooasion it would be expected that what he had to say referred to biological studies. First of all let him ask the question What is biology?\" The word was not a good one, for in the minds of many students it called up ludicrous associations such as staring at asmall brass disc- -(laughter)-and the word was like many other scientific terms etymologically iudefeu- sible. Nevertheless, the word had come into use and they must, he feared, continue to use it. Biology was of many different kinds. There were many amen and women who were imbued with a love of living things, and acquired a personal acquaintance with living thiugs some time or another. One would turn to plants and learn to know all the plants in the neighbourhood. Another hid the same feeling towards birds, another towards fishts, and such persohs they call natur- alists. Naturalists were one kind of biologists, even though they should never care to think, or inquire into the inner structure of the things they knew, and would live on asking no questions as to how they came about. Ai overman not cm ing especially for any living thiugs would delight in the study of auatomy, and such facts as that which told them that the Kuee of the knee of a horse was really uot a knee at all, but only a knucule, and he was a biologist of another kiiid-a comparative anato- mist. Another would observe with int-'rest that a certain plant lie would call it lianjoria p\"kher. rimll-grew on a ledge among the mouut uns here, and after that was not found anywhere nearer than the Alps, aud he would thus be led to attempt to explain this and similar phenomena. He too was a biologist. But the biology which he was advocat- ing there that day w, the science which included the fundamental fac lof a:l these departments of biologi ca. at idles, anii \"hih would form a convenient preliminary to the detailed story of any one of them, if he put the question why biology should be taught iu the Uuive.sity College of North Wales, he supposed he should leceive two kuids of answers. On the one band he would be told that biology ought to be taught io the college as a means of helping tho stu- dents in after-days to earn his bread--that it should ba taught with a professi\u00f9Dal. mj in V;8W; and on the otner hand, that it should bo taught b\" a means of general culture to make the student a better and it wiser man, and more it to take a place of geueral usefulness in the world before him. Let liiui, lirst of all, speak of the study of biology as all introduction to professional study. There ws one profession for which the study of biology of that Kind, if not a complete necessity, was at all events of immense value. He meaut the profession of medicine (applauasl. Perbtps his medical brethren there present would allow him to put the question What is it that a doctor had to do ? According to the statements of some people, one would suppose that all that a doctor had to do when he was called to a patient was to iiud out what was the matter with him, in the sense that he could give a i.ame to his condition, aud call it some defiuite malady, aud then, having been able to name the malady of his patient, to provide the prescribed auti- dote. He ventured to think that that was not the true function of a doctor, and that what the doctor had to learn was not the niint, but the actual nature of the disea\u00bbe,aud in such a wiy as to bring back the errant body to its normal condition (hear, hear). The doctor needed a knowledge of path- ology, and it was not because he was a physiologist that be ventured so say that physiology was the basis of pathology. As a physiologis tht) could say, if it was to be learnt with a certain completeness, and with that grasp of its principles which was ueces- sary for carrying it ou to pathology, and so on 60 the medical art, then it was important that the meiical student should have a grasp of the elomeutiry prin- ciples of biology in general, before he began with the higher stuJy of working out for himself the special problems of physioljgy (applause). They knew that before a docU: leceived a licence to practise, lie must study 1\\t 8 )me recognised medical school. Perhaps they did uot know that a large amount of the time that he spent there was spent, not III learning disease, but ill learning physics, and chemistry, ami biology, as introductory to his study of die\"'He; and out of Che too few years hd had to devote to the manifold ways of meet- iu? disease, he had to take cut a large 3lico in ordu that he might learn simple ques tions of phycics, simple questions of chemistry, and simple questions of elementary physiology. And besides these studies, he had to perform others which resulted in his having to squeeze hims If through the examinatiou dorr with only the minimum knowledge of the actual practical work of the profession (hear, hear). He said that ought not to be (loud a;)plaUfe)--and he conten\u00e081 that the care of the human body was so serious a duty that the three years spent at a medical school were none too many, and that the student who entered a recognised medical school ought to go there ade- quately prepared with physics, chemistry, aud with the elements of biolouy (cheers). But there was another profession to which he would venture to say a knowledge of elementary biology was also, if not necessary, at least of advantage. He referred to the art of agriculture, which seemed ti him t.) demand a wider knowledge, greater skill, and clearer judgment than any other walk of human life (applause). The art of the farmer was based on nearly all the sciences, but especially on the science of biolouy. He had to do largely with the breeding of cattle. It was his duty to produce out of a shilling's worth of fodder the maximntll of nutri- tive flesh and fat, which was exclusively a physio- logical problem, and could not be carried on suc- cessfully by those who were absolutely ignorant of physiology (applause). On the other hand, the farmer had to take a few divers salts and put them into the soil. He had to gather from the soil as much living material as under the circum- stnceq 01 sun, and climate and light, he could get and make the dead soil a live soil. The whole matter of the growth of corn out of the ground became largely a biological problem and he ven- tured, even at the expense of daring to speak about matters about which ha had no authority to speak, to put to them all there whether they thought that the art of fanning had already reachel its maxi- mum; that they could not get more cheaply the same flesh out of fodder, or that they had noW wrung out of the soil as much yield as could eVH p08\"ibly be got? He would ask them to remember what took place. The farmer sowed, say a table- spoonful of different salts. He frequently bought these salts at great expense, because a large quan- tity of that which should be deposited was thrown away, and was carried away by the waters to feed the fishes. The farmer was glad if he got back a mere pinch of the salt in the shape of corn or wheat. Was it not possible, by adequate manipulation of the soil, by adequate selection and handling of the living thing, to advance the art of farming, so that the farmer might get back say a teaspoonful of the salts he puts into the soil, and that thereby a balance might be struck against the import offoreign corn, and the British farmer enabled once more to lift np his head (cheers). He ventured to ask them whether the real solution of our agricultural \"r pr\"' \"ion was not so much a diviion of I&nd aB the multiplication of knowledge (appl?nee). But if elementary biology was to be of use as an introduc- tion to thi and other professions, it must be taught well and judiciously Tho principles must be laid down,and there must be throughout the whole conrde of the instruction a care on the part of the teacher when the methods of biology were illustrated in what it taught. Only in this way could it be taught, and taught in such a mannu p. it could be useful as au introductory study. Biology could not be I. a nt in any true fashion, unless the student had already grasped the fundamental facta and principles of chemistry, physics and mathem- atics. These three formed a triple alliance, an alliance which he might venture t9 call a holy alliance, and one which he hoped would last longer than that of kings (cheers). The study of biology which he was advocating included a broad know- ledge of chemistry, a b-od knowledge of physics, and a knowledge at all events of the elementary matters of mathematics. He would be very bold, and he would ask Was this not in itself a liberal education ? (applause). There were many defiui- tions of a liberal educatiou, but to his mind the true definition was that which was the most effective for bringing out the dormant powers of the individual who WliS being taught. He did njtknow whathis aud- ience thought, but he was much impressed himielf with the tendency to uniformity aad \"levelling\" which was going forward around us, just as the hand of time with the fingers of snow and frost, of rain and wind, was gradually waaring down the picturesque crags of the Alps, and making a futile but monotonous plain so the stress of life ssemed to ba rubbing out individual character, and tending year by year to make us alike. Not only did we dress alike, but speak alike. They could no longer know a man's worth by his speech or his words. We all tended to do the same thing in the same way, for not only like sheep we went astray,\" but like sheep we also went straight (laughter and applause). Mr Galton, at a meeting of the British Association, the other day, told his hearers that everyone was tending very much to be in the same state\u2014to the mediocre state; and be said it was not only in stature that this tendency showed itself, but there was a tendency to a dead level of a monotonous mediocrity. Had not our system of education, enforced by the tarrible arm of examination, whioh tended to become more and more fixed and rigid, driving every boy and girl through the same narrow gate, something to do with it ? It had baen his lot to dabble in many different kinds of learning, although be had generally forgot-, ten the greater part of one when he had taken up another, still he carried with him this belief: tlla, V.111.U all kinds ot studies might be con- sidered good, none ought to he the bast or the indesp usable. It were well of all of us if we could attain ti all kno.lcd\u00a1{e; but WH cauldmit. We inui-t all make our choice 01 wl-i t we wouli know,and \u00bb hat we iiiial lea e unknowJ, to know that which would suit the individual character and life, and to leave that ue which would not suit the individual charactHe w, n perfectly ready to admit that a man rnifc reosne a liberal education who had never learnt c fait of physical science, but he contended thai toe, might be considered of liberal educatio. who might remain ignorant of the aucieut 1.. guts (hear, hear)-and he would ask them especially with regard to the profession which he repieseuted whether they would not rather have a doctor who had been well trained iu physical and ratural science than one who had dabbled in things foreign to his profession (hear, hear). Biology was not ouly a study of culture, but one that trained a student to exact observation, aud he contended that it was even more exact thau the so-called 11 exact science\" of mathematics, for heieexactitude WhS necessary where iueJtacitude was so possible. fhld exactitude of observa.t;on, this truthfulness of was at the very bottom of biological success; biology tudles trained the student to seeing thiugs seeing thiugil in the laboratory, seeing things in his biologic I work, and tnereby C?litiV*tiDg tha ha'Jit of .dug things outside. He knew 110 sUl\"uce which \"Ii.? foith a. greater amount of judgment and although some might ega d it as a weaxaess on LI part, lie couteudeil for its study thut it cultivate.! a faculty wh ch was an e lement of that Btrengtn which was necessary for after-life, for ill that life, surely, it was with uncertain thiins they had to deal. They would bare observed that he had said nothing of oiology as useful knowieug-; and, to tell them the trull, lie was not oue of those who rc. girded the head of a youth as a portmanteau, into which a large quantity of luggage might be stored in the hope that it 111II\u00dc be meful on the journty through life (laughter). His experience had taught him that a great deal wtis spoiled, a groat dial lost by the way, and a great de, l that was never wai t d at all (laughter aud applause). Whut was requited in education was, to his mind, not so much us-.iul knowledge as a training of the ability to lay hold of useful knowledge when the time cams for want- iiig it. But if he would ifiake ilti exception in fav-olir of any kind of knowledge as really useful knowledge he claimed it for the knowledge of Ihosa bodies-of the work and structure of these bodies- which we carried about us all our days (hear, hear). He did not for a moment stippo.-e tint a i elemelJ ary knowledge of physiology would prevent all persons from maltreating their bodies, but he wou d say this, that the evils which came from doing things pleasant and wrong, were leBI than those caused by specious and impossible remed.es. tie thought the gain to the doctors would he a mixed one, inasmuch as s'lch a knowledge would prevent persons consulting them as to those phantom mala- dies, which formed solargea source of their income (laughter). But he thought they woull be willing to lose that fraotion of income, knowing that the increase of knowledge would every (t.), convert their patients into willing help me. ts, instead of being, as they too often are now, wayward and stubborn opponents. These were two reasons why biology should be taught in that college: as an introduction to a profession, and ss to general cul- ture (applauss). He should like t) give another reason why biology should be taught there. The ignorance of people generally concerning that which was kuown was great, but he took it that the igno rance of the learned concerning that which was not known, but minht be known, was still greater, and he held it that it was the function of a ooliee of that kind not only to teach but to learn (applause). He held that all the professors should not only teach but be themselves knocking at Natu-e's door -(hear, hear)- for the tenchcr would b 1 thus pre- vented from becoming mechanical in his work, aud devoid of that touch of iron wh:ch should enter into the pupil's mind (hear, hear). For the sake of the teacher and the teaching, he urged that research should be carried on in that college; but not simply for that reasou, but he asked it for the great things of scienee. We were educating everywhere, everywhere we were putting up a new pump, pump- ing up the waters of knowledge over the heads of the people but let them remember that the water came from the well, and the well-diggers were tnw. A college of that kind had a duty, not only to teach but to learn and he trusted in future that that insti- tution would not only be known as a place of teach- iug, but also as a seat of learning (cheers). Let him say a few words as to how biology should be taught there; and he could say that very simply. It should be taught iu the laboratory. Bioliay came from observation and not by readina, Aud let him here congratulate them on their new biological laboratories, which seemed to him, though small, admirably fitted, and he might say that in many respects put to shame those possessed by older and richer institutions (cheers). But he would like to give those who were about to work 111 the laboratory two words of warning. The other day he was standing cn the summit of Yermatt, from whence a splendid view of Monte Rosa is to be obtained. It was a perfectly lovely day. As he was gazing upon the prospect, there came up two German youths, and they had in their hands those little red hooks of travels issued by the great Baedeker. When they reached the top they sat down with their backs upon Monte Rost, and read the description given ia the gaido-book and this done they went away (much laughter). He found a great deal of travel was carried oil by a process which might be termed reading Biedeker on the spot (renewed laughter). That happened in th: biological laboratory. He knew frim his experi- ence that certain youthful minds thought that the practical year consisted of reading a text-book in the laboratory. He maintained that it was only by going into a laboratory and studying there that a text book could be proved to be right or wrong. From what he knew of their lecturer (Mr Phillips) his old pupil -(applause)\u2014he felt in what he ht(i stid, he had, to a large extent, been speaking his \u00abon'iin-Mits and he was sure he would do his best tn \u00a1,on le the youth of North Wales with the true principles of biology as ho had ventured to lay them down, and that he would do his best that each atndent should actually work iu the laboratory, and th it they should keep the end straight in view (cheers). There was onlv one thing that he feared and it wn this, that Mr Phillips' teaching would he so successful that in a very short time the laboratory would be found so small that thaConnril would have to build another (loud cheers, amidst which Professor Foster resumed his seat). Mr W. A. DARMSIURK said lie rose to perform a very pleasing duty which, when he mentioned it wa a vote of thanks to Professor Michael Foster, who had that day honoured them with his presence, he was sure he should carry with them an unanimous consent to his proposal (cheers). Professor Foster had placed before them the desirability of tudyin biology in such a manner, in such eloquent words that he WBS sure everyone who had entered that room would feel himself a more earnest human being than when he entered (hear, hear). For his own part he had alwaysthoughtt'ne study of biology was one of the most interesting of the sciences, and he was glad when it became more and more evident that they were reqnired to add biol ogy to the rest of the curriculum of that college. He thoueht every young man ought to obtain a knowledge of the sub- ject, and he hoped women would take a very im- portant position iu the study of biology (applause). When he was a very young man, young women did not know very much of that science. If they could interpret the language of the eye, or explaiu the action of a man's heart, that was sufficient (lond laughter). He hoped in future no woman's domestic education would be deemed complete with- out a knowledge of biology. He expressed a hope that Professor Foster's prophesy would c HM true, and that the Council of the College would have to extend the size of the department over which Mr Phillips presided. Mr PUILI.irs said he had very much plea- sure in seconding the proposal which had been made by Mr Darbishire. He confessed that when he first propesed to convey to Professor MichseJ Foster the desire of the Council and Senate of the College that he should open their new bioto- gicllil laboratories, it was with considerable tre- pidation he approached him. He had no misgivings as to Professor Foster's perfect willingness to come down to them, because he was always perfectly reaclv with an encouraging word and a helping hand to assist in any educational work, but with his many engagements as an author, as an editor, and in comectioa with the learned sodetie;<, he was afraid that he might be unable to oome. He was sure they all rejoiced that his many engage- ments had enabled him to be with them that day (applause). He did not know whether it was in this nineteenth centnry right to believe in auguries but he thought hA might say that it auaured well that the biologioal department of the University j College of North Wa10s had been opened 1 y Professor Foster (cheere>. How Professor Michael Foster was esteemed by a very large section of the commnnitv they had lial an illustration in tho address whieh had been read there, and he could assure them that the ordinary science students and medical students vied with each other in Cam- bridge in doing honourto Professor Foster (applause).

I need hardly say that I heartily wel- come \"II extension of biolrjjiotl teaching, and es- pecially practical teaching,and that I shall always he most happy to de nnythin in my power to 8FSist in the e tiblismen.t and equipment of laboratories, especially at places whtre. as at Hit igor, there are I good facilities for cbtiining mateiial. Thanking you for your kindness in sending me an invitation, I remain, yours truly, A. MII.MKS MARSIIAU, They had amongst them thft day a very disiingti:6h<d name indeed\u2014Mr Francis Darwin, the son cf tlut great Rcielltifio man whose worki form an epoch in biological study, and whose name was held in reverence throughout the civilized world (ap- plaust). He was among them, and represented the st'idy of bottny, one of thrso numerous branches which had beeu so ileasautlv des- cribed 111 Professor Michael Foster's adiress. They had also a representative of anot her university, the University of Dublin. lie meant Professor Purcer, Professor of the Institutes of Mediciue. If Professor Purcer was among them that day, he (Principal Reicbel) assured him they were delighted to Hoe him, safe and unboycotted (applause and laughter). Having referred to other di-tiuguiahed vis t'ns and well wishers, be coupled with the proposal the names of Mr Francis Darwin, of Cambiilge University, and Professor Pti-ccr, of Dublin I nive-s ty (applause). Professor DonmE. in the course of a spirited peech, 1i. reconiBiug the widesprea l interest and sympathy on the part of every class of people, those who were officially associated with the college had endeavoured since it was opened to respond to that feeling by d >ing their bist to make the collage useful to all ch:Jcs of t'l community r,\u00a1;plau.e). A }Clr :0 thAre wu no provision whatever for the training of tnelical tn lents, but he was happy to be able to say they had not only been recoguised by other Universities, bnt they had succeeded in attracting genuine medical students. On these grounds they rej iced to see amongst them that afternoon so a reprfsentation of the medical profession of the northern part of tIM Principality. After some further remarks h5 asked those present to join him in a hearty vote of thanks to the distinguished visitors who were with them th-t day. The motion was received with ap[11a11S0. Mr FRANCIS DAIUVIN, havirg alluled to the fact that the last occasion upon which lie found himself a visitor to that b!ock of buildii gs was when thev formed an hotel, said he was sure he expressed the feeling of everyone of the visitors when be said that they h\\d great pleas ire in assist- ing at the inauguration of the Biolog'cal Labora- tiry of the University College of North Wales. The labora'ories were admirably fitted, and heanti- cipatsd good work there. Referring to Mr Phillips, the biological lecturer of the college, he said him first acquaintance with him was when he was a student, and as such he hal the knack of asking questions uncomfortably difficult to answer. He thought they could not wish him anything bottir than that he might have a long series of students, all cipabla of asking similar questions (laughter and applause). And he might add a hope that he might be able to answer them better than he (Mr Darwin) did (aonlanse). His interest in that labjratory was chiedy from a bit inical point of new. They had there all th conditions that they wanted. In some centres of teaching, for instance in Manchester, the air was so poisoned that the teaahers were almost in despair. There they had pure air; and they had admirable light, which was the second desideratum (applause). He thou bt, on the whole, they were most warmly to be cong\" ratulated in the very perfect laboratory which wasbeing opened that day, and he could truly say th.t in going through it that morning that one of his strongest feelings were those of envy (laughter and anplause). He concluded by acknowledging the vote of thanks to the visitors that day. It having been auoounced that I'rofe sor Purcer was not present, the CHAIRMAN said all present would be interested in going through the various depart- ments of the college, which they were at liberty to do. The proceedings, which lasted over two hours, then terminated, and a large number of persons visited the new laboratory as well as other portion* of the buildings.",

                "full_text": "LONDON\" UNIVERSITY DEGREES. IMPORTANT ALTERATIONS. j (Special to The Camlriun .) Changes of some import to student* looking forward to degrees in the University of London have recently been announced in each case the effect is to reduce the number of subjects which must be offered for examination. and it remains to be seen whether this will be counterbalanced by the increase in the difficulty of the papers. For Matriculation five subjects will be required from January, 1899, instead of tli9 six now necessary: the five subjects include four which are compulsory for all, viz., Latin. English, Mathematics, and Elementary Science, and a fifth which is to be chosen from the following languages or sciences :\u2014Greek. French. German, Mechanics, Chemistry. Sound. Heat and Light. Electricity, Botany. It is worthy of note that the general tendency of science teaching in secondary schools has now had its effect, and a paper in general Elementary Science is sub- stituted for the paper hitherto set in Chemistrv or Botany. Another point is the disappearance of Mechanics\u2014that great bugbeat of classical students\u2014from the li-t of compulsory subjects, and its relegation to a more suitable position in the group of optional subjects of which one only is to be taken. There can be no doubt that these changes will make the Matriculation more accessible to students with strong- proclivities towards either languages or mathematics those of the former type need no longer take mechanics, whilst the mathematicians have only one language (Latin) to present in addition to English. The changes in the Intermediate Examination in Science are of a similar character. Up to the present four subjects have been required from all, Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics and Biology, and the last subject has proved a stumbling block to many private students chiefly on account of the difficulty in obtaining the instruction in laboratory work which was essential for success in Biology much more even than in chemistry. The reduction in the number of subjects will undoubtedly be a great boon to many and should tend to remove some of the present disparity in numbers between the arts and science graduates of London. At the same hne the amount of work required in chemistry aim pliy.-i^, hpl'r1 somewhat p increased, the new syllabus in each subject bem- a decided improvement upon the old one, and a considerable amount of praccical work is required in both. Similar changes have been made in some of the other examinations of the University, having the effect in every case of reducing the number of subjects required whilst slightly j raising the amount of knowledge demanded in each separate subject. All the changes come into effect in 1399, and must considerably affect the work of students preparing for any examina- tion of the University in that or in subsequent years.",

ELECTRO BIOLOGY\u2014Last week we referred to Miss James's entertainment in Mesmerism and Electro Biology, .Y intimating that the young lady was winning golden opi- nions from all sorts and conditions of men/ We hnd that her popularity is yet on the increase. The Fonty- rolians gave her a bumper house\" on Monday night, after a three week's stay amongst them. Mr. James, the \u25a0yomi\" lady's father, announced, with chracteristic libera- lity, that after giving a benefit for the Literary Institu- tion, he was about to give a series of benefits for the suf- ferers by the late melancholy catastrophe at Hartley,-an announcement that was received with load cheers. Miss James purposes revisiting this town at an early opportu- nity \u2014Having spoken previously of her capabilities, we would simply add that at the entertainment, on Monday, the fair damsel even eclipsed her former exploits, which led one of our rhymers to exclaim- What wondrous power What mystic skill This fair enchantress has acquired For men all potent by her will Assume what characters, desired. Hence Roger leaves his rural home, To see the fun being fully bent, Ahd on the stage he does become An orator in Parliament.\" -And indeed she makes her subjects assume what cha- racter she thinks proper- members of parliament, teetotal lecturers, justices of the peace, or any other character re- quired.

PAROCHIAL RATES.\u2014 A large number of summonses were returnable to-day that had been issued against par- ties for the nonpayment of poors' rate. Many of the de- fendants appeared and sought exemption on the ground of non-occupation of the premises rated, but as the pro- prietors, generally, bad compounded by paying certain amounts, whether the houses or tenements were occupied or not, the exemptions could not be allowed. This formed all the business transacted in the police court this morning. \"WEDNESDAY. (Before C. H- WILLIAMS, Esq.)

                "full_text": "SCIENCE DEGREES AT THE LONDON UNIVERSITY. The University of London has issued a set of revised regulations relating to the examinations for the degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Science conferred by the University. The nature of the alterations made is explained in a report made by a committer to which the work of the revision of the regula- tions was intrusted. The report, after staling the principle on which the committee have acted so as to bring up the regulations to the require- ments of scientific education as at present conducted, says:\u2014\" The committee have framed a new set of regu- lations for the degree of Bachelor of Science, which they now submit to the consideration of the Senate. In the first examination, which every car did ate will 'be required to pass, while the programmes in mathe- matics, experimental physics, and inorganic chemistry, have been carefully revised, little fundamental change has been made in them. In place of the superficial acquaintance with both zoology and botany formerly required at this examination, the committee now recommend a single examination (written and practical) in general biology, in which a more thorough knowledge shall be required of the simplest forms and elementary phenomenaof animal and vegetable life, such as is now made the basis of the teaching of some of the most distinguished professors in each department. Thus the student who may be intending to devote himself specially to physical or chemical science will be bronght to apprehend the general conceptions common to the two great organic kingdoms, without being required to master the specialities of either. And the student who intends to present himself at the second B.Sc. examination in either physiology, zoology, or botany, or all combined, will have laid the best founda- tion for those special studies in the study of general biology. The regulations for the second B.Sc. ex- amination, on the other hand, are framed with the view of allowing the candidate to bring up any three of the following nine subjects:\u20141, Pure mathematics; 2, mixed mathematics 3, experimental physics; 4, chemistry; 5, botany, including vegetable physiology 6, zoology; 7, animal physiology; 8, physical geo- graphy and geology 9, logic and psychology. It is intended by the committee that the examinations in these several subjects should be, as nearly as may be, on the same grade as to the amount of attainment they require. They have learned from the examiners in mathematics that their experience justifies them in stating that any candidate who has thoroughly mastered the mathematics of the first B.Sc. examination, and has such an aptitude for the study as would lead him to select pure mathematics as one of his subjects at the second, would find no difficulty in mastering tbe re- quirements of its programme by such An amount of gtudy, carried on through an eight months' academical session, as would leave him free to bestow the same amount of time and atfention on two or even three other pubjects. And the committee would wish it to be understood, therefore, that in propos- ing that each candidate should have his choice of any three out of the nine subjects just specified, the amount of proficiency expected in each would be that which he might attain by the steady devotion to it of about one-third of the sessional work of a diligent student.\" It may also be mentioned that in the matri- sulatlon examination, which forms the basis of the science curriculum, German may now be taken in sub- stitution for Greek. In regard to the doctor's degree, also a change has been made in favour of candidates who prolong the interval between their first and second examinations for the degree of bachelor from one year to two, or more as such will be allowed to como up for the degree of Doctor of Science within a year of their attaining the degree of Bachelor.",

We are heartily glad to be able to give this account of the corps. ELECTRO-BIOLOGY AND MESMERISM.\u2014On Monday evening M. Zamoiski gave his interesting entertainment on Electro-Biology and Mesmerism, at the Gate House Assembly Room. The room was well filled, and M. Zamoiski has been induced to repeat his performance on Friday and Monday next. THE ELIGOG STACKS.\u2014These remarkable rocks, in the neighbourhood of St Gowans, known as the Eligog Stacks, are now well worthy of a visit from visitors to our town. The birds, which form the principal objects of attraction, are now congregated in immense numbers on the Stack rocks. TRUE IVORITES.\u2014On Tuesday last, the Tenby Lodge of True Ivorites held their annual meeting, and attended divine service at the parish church, and paraded through through the principal streets of the town, accompanied by the Tenby Volunteer .brass band. They numbered about eighty members. SAUNDERSFOOT.\u2014The Benefit Club of this village met according to annual custom, on Saturday, the 12th inst., at the Picton Castle Inn, from whence they marched in procession, headed by a brass band. On their return they sat down to an excellent and substantial dinner, where, after the usual toasts, &c, they concluded the evening with dancing. ACCIDENT.\u2014On Monday, the 14th inst., as a collier boy aged about fourteen years, of the name of Absolom, was working at the Grove Pit, a large stone in the upper part of the working became loosened and fell on him, breaking one of his legs and severely lacerating the muscles. We hear that though the limb is in a very bad state there is a chance of its being saved. CONCERT.\u2014We hear it is the intention of the St. Florence choir to give a concert before long. As tbe formation and advancement ot the choir of St. Florence has occupied the earnest attention of the worthy rector, tho Rev. Mr Birkett, for the last thirty-five years, we may be sure of an afternoon's agreeable amusement. One night last week, Capt. Bailey, accompanied by some friends, was driving a spirited horse down the Norton, when the animal suddenly made off at a tremen- dous speed. One gentleman and the servant jumped out, and the vehicle pursued its course with increased velocity till it neared the rectory gate, when the horse swerved down with its fore legs at the bottom and the hind legs at the 0p of tbe steps, unable to extricate itself. Capt. Bailey was thrown out and was picked up insensible. We are happy to say that, beyond being stunned, he suffered no injury.",

The Press Association learns that Lord Iveagh is proposing a comprehensive scheme, which will probably cost him a quarter of a million sterling, for the improvement, of the insanitary area in the heart of the city of Dublin. His proposal, which will take the form of a Bill in the coming session of Parliament, contemplates the acquiring the area between Bull-alley and Bride's-alley, and utilising the site partly by giving certain portions to the Dublin Corporation for otritigi:t,,ni.g, ing, and improving adjacent streets, but chiefly for the erection of two classes of buildings, viz.. workmen's dwellings, a lodging-house for single men, and shops; also certain recreative build- ings, such as a large concert hall, reading and lecture rooms, swimming bath, and gymna-I sium. The promoter will execute the whole scheme at his own cost. THE PREVENTION OF DISEASE. The Press Association has been requested to publish tll\" following communication respect- ing -an offer of a quarter of a million made by Lord Iveagh to the council of the Jenner Institute, and its acceptance on behalf of that body by Lord Lister and Sir Henry Roscoe: \u2014 \"We ask permission to announce a splendid offer in aid of scientific research which has been placed in our hands. British and Irish men of science have long deplored the fact that the opportunities in this country for research directed to the prevention of dise\u00bb39 are not equal to those possessed by foreign nations. Lord Iveagh wishes to help in removing this reproach to our country, and, on the conditions named below, has offered the sum of E;250,000 for the purposes of the highest research in bacteriology and other forms of biology as bearing upon the cause, nature, prevention, l1>'d treatment of disease. He has proposed to thi council of the Jenner Institute lately the British Institute) of Preventive Medicine, a body which includes the leading men in medicine and the allied sciences in the British Isles, that the donation shall be handed over to the institute on condition that in future the control and management of the affairs of the institute shall bo placed in the hands of a new board of seven trustees\u2014three of the seven to be chosen by the council of the insti- tute, three by the donor, and one by the council of the Itoyal Society. The offer has been cordially accepted at a meeting of the council. The donor further proposes that part of the new fund shall be appropriated to the enlargement of the buildings of the institute at Chelsea, part to increasing the at present sadly inadequate salaries of the director and other members of the scientific staff, part :c the expenses of administration and maintenance, and the remainder chiefly to founding valuable fellowships and studentships, tenable for limited periods, for research, either in tho laboratories of the institution or in centres of outbreaks of disease, whether at home or abroad. The conditions on which these fellowships and studentships may be held are not yet deter- mined upon, but it is hoped to open them to all classes of her Majesty's subjects. Lord Iveagh, in our opinion, deserves the gratitude of the nation for thus munificently providing for the cultivation in the British dominions of biology and allied sciences for the good of mankind in an institution which thenceforth will compare favourably with any similar establishments in other parts of the world.\u2014 We have the honour to be, sir, your obedient servants, LISTER, Chairman of Council, \"HENRY E.

                "full_text": "\"PATRIOTISM\" OF THE BASER SORT. Dr. Rawlings, of Swansea, the Free Church leader, suffered a hostile de- monstration at a Sketty brotherhood meeting where he had engaged to speak on the debt of the world to Ger- man thinkers. A number of small- minded persons in the audience thought fit to protest against the idea that there is anything in the German nation worth appreciating. Such in- sensate chauvinism brands the demon- strators as ignoramuses. Whatever disservice German militarism has done the world, there is no doubt that Ger- man scholarship has laid all nations under an ineffaceable debt. Goethe, Schiller, and Heine are among the great poets of all time. Marx, Engels, and LassaHe, gave form and purpose to the aspirations of the working classes throughout the world. Haeckel is supreme in biology as Harnack is in theology. Erlich, the discoverer of salvarsan, has come nearest of anybody to finding a cure for one of the most dreadful scourages of the human race. In municipal matters and public health Germany leads the world. They, are abreast wfth us in electrical engineer- ing, and ahead of us in commercial chemistry. There is no doubt that mankind is heavily indebted to Ger- man thinkers and scientists, and whole- heartedly as we may execrate the call- ous and bloody doctrines of Clause- witz, Bernhardi, Crampf, and other exponents of fire-eating philosophy, we must pay tribute to the achievements of the minds of peaceful Germany. The ulcer of militarism must be removed from the German body. It will not be done by the type of the boorishness and bigotry displaced at Sketty.",

                "full_text": "ELECTRIC LADIES. A curious communication of particular interest to both sexes has just been made by M. Fere to the French Society of Biology. The doctor has dis- covered an electric woman. The name and address of this phenomenon are not given, probably to avoid her being got hold of by some enterprising Barnum. It appears that both her hair and body emit electric sparks. The electricity is more visible when the hair is combed. The h\u010d r then stamds on an end. When she puts on her underclothing its contact with her skin first produces a crepitation, then the clothes adhere as it were to the body, and finally her move- ments are partly paralysed. These phenomena are particularly observable during dry and frosty weather. The electric tension also increases under the influence of emotions\u2014such, for example, as the effect of music, which augments the crepitation. This extraor- dinary creature, however, is not unique. Dr. Lagu6 mentioned the case of a woman who during an aurora borealis was suddenly charged with electricity, which manifested itself when she passed her fingers over the face of her brother; she remained electric for two months. Another instance of a similar kind is re- ported by Arago. In all these cases the patients are described as of sickly disposition, subject to nervous or hysterical attacks. In the Middle Ages they would have been burnt for being possessed with the devil, to-day they are tended and petted as scientific wonders. Strange to say, the first account of an electric woman is to be found in a romance by the Brothers Goncourt.",

Radium is elDfJioyed in- therapeutics for destroying by its rays or emanation the microbes of tuberculosis in diseased lungs, and other purposes, its use is likely to spread, and Mr. Hugo Lieber has been studying the best mode of applying it. In a paper to the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine, New York, he has described a method which is effective and simple. He prefers to use the radium salt, for example, bromide, emitting the rays in very thin layers, or what he calls \"mIlium coatings.\" To prepare the coatings the radium salt is dissolved in alcohol, and a ceiluloid rod is dipped into it, then withdrawn. The alcohol evaporates and leaves a thin layer Of the salt upon the rod, which can be fixed by dipping the rod into collodion solution, quickly -it, and letting the collodion dry. Aniline dye added to the solution of salt or the collodion shews the extent of the coating. The collodion is permeable by the rays and emanation of the salt, which are capable of producing bright- Scintillations on a screen of zinc sulphide and other eilects. Such coatings can be applied to practically all parts of the body, and instruments can be coated in the Same way. For application the rod may be e-iclosed in a tube of glass or aluminium. lu Tubes coated internally with the radium salt in this wav can bc- used in cases of tuberculosis. Mr. Lieber also remarks that the radioactivity of such thin coatings is not diminished by boiling them.",

Professor Lloyd Tanner has resigned the chair of mathematics in the University College of South Wales and Mon. after being associated with that seat of learning for over a quarter of a century.

Thompson .(chemistry), Pro- fessor Parker (biology), Professor Powel (Welsh), and Professor Barbier (French). Pro- fessor Lloyd Tanner is one of the most eminent mathematicians of his time. In pure mathe- matics he is in the front rank, and his name n held in the highest esteem among the savants of the Continent. He was born in 1851, of Welsh parents, and educated at Bristol Grammar School and Jesus College, Oxford. He won the highest honours in his subject, and proved himself a successful teacher at King's School, Sherborne; the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester and as a master in Bristol Grammar School. He came to Cardiff with the highest recommendations, and has proved himself one of the most eminent teachers associated with the Univer- sity College. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society mainly for his brilliant work on Differential Equations he is a D.Sc., M.A., F.R-A-S., A.R.S.M., &c.

As ,an instance of this, it will be noticed that the result of the London School Board Election (which was only announced late on November 27th) is recorded in the article School Board for London.\" Under the heading of Occurrences during Printing the reader will also find the most recent incidents prior to publication. The increased interest in individuals \u2014the love of the personal,\" as Lord Beacons- field termed it-has led to the addition of one hundred new biographies, so that the book con- tains nearly one thousand of these articles. The questions which are now claiming so much public attention have been fully noticed in the Annual. A most exhaustive record of the Labour Legislation of the past, and a detailed account of State Pensions will commend themselves to the student of social politics. The many sections of Education, giving full particulars as to Manual Training,\" Higher Education of Women,\" Continuation Schools,\" etc., occupy much space. More than one hundred pages are devoted to Parliamentary matters, including the usual extensive record of the work of the Session Lists of the Members of both Hou>es of the Legislature New Acts the Reports of various Committees and Commissions complete details as to the Privy Council and history of Irish (Nationalist) Parliamentary Parties. General topics of interest are discussed under the titles- Banks, \"Cabs,\" \"Trade,\" Stock Exchange,\" \"Yeomanry,\" Mercantile Marine,\" 'Omnibuses,' \"Theosophy,\" Noms-de-Plume,\" Biology,\" Hypnotism.\" Full accounts of engineering accomplishments and legal decisions are also given. The book now contains 728 pages, being an increase of 160 pages as compared with the first edition.",

A deputation representing the University Colleges of Bangor and Aberystwyth attended on Tuesday afternoon at the offices of the Board of Trade, London, in order to place before the Department their views in favour of a subsidy to the Colleges for the establishment of marine biological stations in cannection with their zoological laboratories. Owing to some misunderstanding Mr Gerald Bal- four, the President of the Board, was unable to receive the deputation. The duty was left to Mr F J Hopwood, the new Permanent Secretary. The deputation included Lord Kenyon (president of Bangor College), Lord Rendel (president of Aberystwyth College), Principal Reichel (Bangor), Principal Roberts (Aberystwyth), Sir J Hills- Johnes (treasurer of the University of Wales), Dr Isambard Owen (deputy chancellor), Dr White (Bangor), and the following members of Parlia- ment Messrs Humphreys-Owen, William Jones, Osmond Williams, Colonel Pryce-Jones, Vaughan Davies, and Keir Hardie. Several of these gentle- men explained the objects of the deputation, and pointed out the assistance already rendered in this direction, more especially by the Carnarvonshire County Council and the Lancashire and Western Sea Fisheries' Beard, and the reasons in favour of granting Imperial aid for the same purpose. Mr William Jones, who had the advantage of a previous conversation with the President of the Board of Trade, informed the meeting that it was the intention of the Government to appoint a Departmental Committee to consider the whole question of British fisheries, and urged the Colleges to prepare evidence to submit to such Committee. Mr Hopwood supplied official confirmation of this, and the deputation were content to accept the suggestion thus put before them. It is understood that Mr Herbert Maxwell, M.P., is to be the chair- man of the Committee.",

Martin, of The Hill, Abergavenny, had been killed in action on May 2nd, for he was popular and. highly respected by all who knew him. Much sympathy is felt for his wife and infant son in their sad bereavement. Lieut. Martin, who joined the 3rd Mons. in 1912, was in com- mand of the Machine Gun Section. We under- stand that he was killed by a shell, which also caused other casualties among the section, and according to letters from the front, his death is sincerely regretted by the officers and men of the battalion. Lieut. Martin, who was 33 years of age, was the only son of the late Mr. Edwin Martin, of The Hill, one of the captains of industry in South Wales, In 1912 he married Miss Han- bury, daughter of Mr. F. P. J. Hanbury, of Nantoer. He was educated at Eton and Mag- dalene College, Oxford, where he acquired high scientific attainments and earned a name for himself by his erudition in biology and its sub division of bacteriology. He lectured at Cam- bridge and at some of the Scottish colleges, and his opinion was often sought far and wide in regard to the subjects which he had made him- self an authority. An all-round sportsman, Lieut. Martin was a keen follower of the Mon- mouthshire Hounds, and was a popular Master of the Crickhowell Harriers. He was a useful cricketer and an enthusiastic golfer, and was a prominent member of the Monmouthshire Golf Club. I",

That the occasion was one of more than ordinary interest was evidenced bv the large audience, including, in particular, so many members of the medical profession, which assembled in the largo Lecture Theatre of the college to hear Professor MICHAKL FOSTER. Of the address which the professor delivered, no other evidence was needed of the appreciation with which it was received, than the unflagging interest with which it waslistened to from beginning to end. Rarely have the inhabitants of the neighbourhood been regaled with such au intellectual treat as when Pro- feasor FOSTER delivered his remarkably able address at once brimful of humour and weighty with wisllolll. Especial interest attached to the presentation which the North Wales Branch of the British Medical Association made to Dr. FOSTKU in tho early part of the proceedings. The College now possesses those means of instruction in biology, chemistry, and physics which Dr. FOSTER regards as a necessary preliminary for professional medical study. Upon the arrangements with the Modical Schools of Edinburgh and Glasgow, by which students may spend one year of the four years' medical course required by those Universities at the University College of North Wales, we have previously dwelt in our columns. We are pleased to learn that Welsh students are already taking advantage of those privileges. All the friends of the Colloge will rejoice at this and other signs of the wide.sproad apprecia- tion in which the College at Bangor is held.",

The problem of evolution in the light of Mendelian discoveries with regard to heredity formed the subject of the first part of Professor W. Bateson's presidential address on Friday night to the British Association for the. Advancement of Science which is now holding its meetings in Austra ia. Professor Bateson considered specially the nature of variation, and showed the difficulty of any longer maintaining the re- ceived doctrines on variations and the origin of the species. While they went to Darwin for his incomparable collection of facts Darwin spoke no 'onger with philoso- phical authority. In face of what they now knew of the distribution of variability in nature the sc pe claimed for natural selection in determining the fixity of the species must be greatly reduced. It has been said that in physics the age was one of rapid progress and profound sceptism. In at least as high a degree this was true of biology, and as a chief characteristic of modern evolutionary thought they must confess also to a deep but irksome humility in the presence of vital problems. Every theory of evolu- tion must be such as to accord with the facts of physics and chemistry, a primary necessity to which our predecessors paid small heed. But the physics and chemis- try of life we kn^w. next to nothing. They would be greatly helped in the study of this problem by some indication as to whether the origin of life had been single or multiple. Modern opinion was inclined to the latter theory, but we had no real evidence. Indeed, the problem still stood outside the range of scientific in- vestigation, and when they heard of the spontaneous formation of formaldehyde mentioned as a..possible first step in the origin of life, they thought of Harry Laiufer 1.\u00cen the character of a Glasgow schoolboy, pulling out his treasurers from his pocket\u2014\"That's a washer-for makkin' motor-cars\"",

Crocker, of San Francisco, arrangements have been completed to despatch an expedition from the Lick Observatory to Flint Island, in the Pacific Oce&n, in order to observe the total solar eclipse of January 3 1908. Owing to a landslide near Cureggio \\Italv) on the Borgomanera-San Live de Arano line, the engine of a train and two carriages left the rails, and the driver and fireman were fatally injured. At a meeting of the Poplar Board of Guar- dians it was stated that an applicant for relief had been employed by one firm for seventy-eight years, and that another had been in one place for twenty-one years. \"Get a book, pick out a few extraordinary words which nobody understands, and tl\u00bbn let off steam,\" was the advice of a Brentfora, mag- istrate who fined a man 5s. for using ba<TTan- guage for three-quarters of an hour. A well-known professional singer, named Marie Solomini, was found murdered in her house at Brescia. The unfortunate woman had I been strangled, and the murderer had escaped with 15,000 lire. A Department of Economic Biology has been formed at Bristol University College with a view to placing the resources of scientific know- ( ledge and research at the disposal of farmers, j fruit growers, and those engaged in fisheries in | the western counties. Householders at King's Lynn are paying j Is..3d. per hundredweight for coal.

Berthelot read a letter from Professor Ramsay, the co-discoverer with Lord Jtayleigh of argon, giving the first announcement of Another discover^ of the same nature. This new gas he proposes to call crypton. The discovery was effected, like that of argon, by the aid of the spectroscope. The presence of crypton was detected by the existence in the spec- trum of a green line, which M. Berthelot saw in a minute tube containing the two-millionth of a pound which Professor Ramsay had sent j with his letter. According to the description for- warded to M-Berthelot.crypt.on belongs,not to tbeargon but to the helium family, and its density is somewhat greater than that of oxygen. It appears to be a simple body and monamatic. For these details M, Berthelot offers the guarantee of the well-known ability of the discoverer. Professor Ramsay states that he will collect a larger quantity of crypton for further researches, of the results of which he will give the Academy the first information. M. Berthe- lot called attention to the compliment paid to the Academy by so many Englishmen of science in salu- ting it as the medium of publicity for their discove- ries. This, he said, was an answer to the intrigues 'of obscure personages who tried to create a chasm between the two leading pioneers of modern science and civilisation. The effect remained to be seen on hygiene and biology of the acknowledged presence of so many substances in that atmospheric gas which we inhaled from our first to our last breath.",

                "full_text": "DARWIN. Twenty-five years ago, says the Graphic, Mr. Darwin was one of the most unpopular men in England. He was denounced as a writer who had done what he could to undermine religion, and his opinions were generally held to be incompatible with any sincere belief in the dignity of human nature. Yet he was buried in Westminster Abbey; and on Tuesday, when Mr. Boehm's beautiful statue was unveiled in the Natural History Museum, all classes were repre- sented in the brilliant assemblage which came to- gether to see the ceremony. There has never, perhaps, been a more remarkable change in the general estimate of a great man. To some extent it is due to the fact that his theory is no longer held to be compatible with religious doctrines. Many promi- nent Christian teachers are ardent believers in evolu- tion, and they maintain that the new principle has given fresh significance and vitality to the most essential articles of their creed. Popular opinion has also been impressed by the extraordinary effect which Darwinism has produced in every department of science and philosophy. Since 1859, when The Origin of Species was published, astonishing progress has been made in biology; psychology, ethics, and social science; and the principal cause of this advance has been the applica- tion of Darwin's method both to the subjects which he himself studied and to subjects in which he was not so directly interested. No one, of course, pre- tends that he was the first to proclaim the doctrine of Evolution but it was he who made it credible by his exposition of the causes by which the gradual transformation of species is effected. To Darwin, therefore, belongs the honour of having started one of the greatest of modern intellectual movements, and there can be no doubt that when the time comes for finally determining his place in history his name will be second to that of no other thinker of the nine- teenth century.",

                "full_text": "AN INSTITUTE OF MEDICAL SCIENCE. If the appeal from the University of London I for funds to endow an institute of medical science commands the attention which its importance deserves, it should meet with a liberal response. The existing system of medical education in London is in a sense out of date. The medical schools do splendid work consider- ing their resources, but with the means at their disposal they cannot build, equip, and maintain the laboratories which are necessary for modern scientific teaching. There are certain branches of instruction from which the medical schools would glady be set free, so that they could devote all their energies to clinical subjects of medicine and surgery. What the University of London proposes is to take out of the hands of the schools the teaching of physics, chemistry, biology, and physiology, and to centralise instruction on those subjects in the Institute of Medical Science. The institution will not be in competition with the schools. The views of the teachers in those institutions have been ascertained, and no opposi- tion or disapproval is to be apprehended from that quarter. The appeal points out the J exceptional opportunities which London affords for the study of medicine and surgery. Patients I suffering from every kind of disease are to be found in its hospitals. Students may learn from I the experience and skill of physicians and surgeons who are among the most eminent in Europe. The one thing wanted is such an I institute as the University of London proposes to establish.",

Moss, M.P., says:\u2014\"Until Mr Balfour made his statement in the House of Commons I thought these bills (Sale of Drink to Children and Monmouthshire Sunday Closing) would certainly get through the Commons during the session just ended. I saw, however, little hope of this beinlr done, despite the feeling in the country, no less than 4000 petitions having been presented in their favour. The secret influence of the brewing interest is apparently making itself felt. As the Government have adhered to their position by giving no opportunities for the further pro- gress of these bills, I hope that the electorate will remember it when the day of reckoning comes round.

The humble peti- tion of the undersigned, being the committee appointed by the representatives of the promoters of the College of North Wales, sheweth that several colleges have of late years been founded in the more populous dis- tricts of this country, with the view of affording to the inhabitants thereof greater facilities for obtaining an education similar to that given in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and other learned institutions. That it is expedient for the encouragement of persons desirous of acquiring superior education, that they should have the advantage of prosecuting their studies in colleges which are able to impart advanced and systematic instruction in the branches of learning and science such as are at the present time taught at the before-mentioned universities and learned institutions that for such objects your petitioners are desirious that a college should be established at Bangor in North Wales, believing that if such college were incorporated it would effectually promote the advancement of educa- tion in Wales, one of your Majesty's most loyal districts. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray and venture to hope that your Majesty may be graciously pleased to grant a charter incorporating a college for North Wales, and that the site of such college may be at Bangor.\" The contract of Mr Evan Williams, Garth ( \u00a3 1,850), has been accepted for the erection of the laboratories, and Mr R. Jenkins, Tennyson-street, Liverpool, has been appointed clerk and collector. The following appointments will be made at the council meeting on September 5th :-Demonstrators in chemistry, physics lecturer on biology, lecturer on Welsh, and assistant professor of classics.",

During the discussion on the scope of the university Dr R. D. Roberts thought degrees should be obtain- able by students outside the three constituent colleges, who, however, had followed a course of study prescribed by the university, while Mr Lewis Morris was in favour of granting degrees to all comers who chose to present themselves, and were able to satisfy the examiners.\u2014Mr Wm. Williams, senior inspector ot Welsh schools, was in favour of the scheme of the charter, thinking it more advisable that students should attempt to gain scholarships at one of the colleges or obtain private means to enable them to attend a course at one of the colleges th,.in to protect their studies under difficulties out- side.No resolution was passed in the matter beyond the one already given.\u2014The senate of the college reported that the Royal College of Physicians a.nd Surgeons had recognised the University College of Wales as a place of instruction in chemistry, physios, practical chemistry, and biology, so that in future, students taking the medical course will be able to take a whole of the first part at the college, except in respect of anatomy and physiology.\u2014It was stated that the number of studenta at present in the college is 225, of whom no fewer than 92 are women.",

I MEETING AT NOTTINGHAM, The attendance of members, British and foreign, at the British Association meeting at Nottingham on Thursday morning was in. creased to close upon 2,000. Tho eight sections met that morning for the addresses of the respective presidents. In the mathematical and physical scotion Mr. R. T. Glazebroolc, as president, speaking on electrical standards, said the resolutions adopted at Edinburgh would be made the basis of legislation throughout the world. Professors Emerson and Reynolds, in the chemical section, described the work of the past twelve months as substantial in character, and gave an outline of Comparative chemistry.\" Mr. J. J. H. Teall discussed the Hutton theory in the geological section, and ailirmed that the early stages of the planet's history still formed a legitimate subject for speculation. The president's address in the section on biology was. in the absence of Canon Tristram, read by Sir W. Flower. Canon Tristram warned the observer of facts against the danger of becoming a mere materialist. -In the geographical section Mr, Kenry Lee- bohiii contributed an interesting address on ex- ploration, on economic science, and statistics. Professor Nield Nicholson claimed that signs of a re-action in favour of the old position of Adam Smith were rapidly increasing. Aerial naviga- tion and fuel supply were the sub- ject of Mr. Jeremiah Head's address in the mechanical service section. Dr. Robert Munro, in the anthropological section, traversed the recent theory of Mr. Robert Wallace, and urged that against that srentleman's hypothesis on natural selection were the probability that many tribes of savages w re in point of civilisation more degenerate than their forefathers, and that there must be some foundation of truth in the widely-spread tradition of the fall of man.",

A correspondent writes as followsWhilst the question of the site is still unsettled, and many necessary preliminaries have yet to be arranged prior to the establishment of the new college, which is, for the present at least, to com- plete the arrangements for higher education ia Wales, it is satisfactory to find that the authori ties of the existing college at Aberystwith art not neglecting the work which lies immediately before them. The committee of a scholarship fund originated some time ago, at Aberystwith, have resources at their disposal which enable them to offer for open competition, at the begin. ning of next year, two scholarships of the valiu of E20 each, tenable at the college. The contri buttons of visitors to the college during the sum- mer season, with a supplementary grant from the council, are also available for two adaitiona' scholarships of like value, and four exhibitions of the value of \u00a310 each, to be competed for at tilt samo time. Thanks to the timely aid of thE Government, the council are able to meet these outside efforts by making important additions to the teaching staff. Two assistant lecturers have recently been appointed, Mr W. Newton Parker, late demonstrator in biology at South Kensington, in the natural science department, and Mr Henry Jones, M.A., of Glasgow, in the department of mental philosophy. A very eligible opportunity is thus placed within the reach of young Welshmen to avail themselves of the advantages of higher education. During last session many of the students at Aberystwith gained distinctions at the English universities, two of them taking the first place in honours at the intermediate examinations for the degrees of B.A., and B.S. respectively at the London Uni- versity. It is hoped that the scholarships and exhibitions now offered will be the means of in- ducing several of our talented young countrymen to pursue a career which will, we trust, lead to like honourable results;",

He had translated into Russian \"The Principles of Biology of Herbert Spencer, Page's Philoso- phy of Geology,\" and Maxwell's Theory of Heat, and for several years contributed to Russian periodicals reviews of the progress of physical astronomy. In two papers on the Milky Way he familiarised Russian readers with the results contained in the recent literature on the subject. In 1874 be edited oiie of the volumes of the memoirs of the Geographical Society, but in the same year be was exiled to Minusinsk, in East Siberia, by simple order of the Administration. At Minusinsk he helped Dr Martianoff in organising a local museum, carried on for several years meteorological obser- vations, which were printed by the KazrenSociety of Naturalists, and contributed a general description of the Sayan mountains and Minusinsk district to the thirteenth volume of Picturesque Russia.\" When at Minusinsk, and later on at Tomsk, he busily worked at a great astronomical undertaking, in which he submitted to a strongly scientific criticism all our present knowledge Oil the structure of the stellar systems and the architectonics of the stellar groups. The difficul- ties which an exile to Siberia has to struggle against did not permit the author bringing it up to a date more advanced than 1879, and the work remained therefore unpublished\u2014Krapotkin, pro- posing to revise it as soon as lie would be liberated, there being hope that he would be liberated from administrative exile in September this year.",

Sir Henry Roscoe writes to the Times :-In the interesting and well-informed leader on the question of State aid to University Colleges in your issue of Saturday last you appear to imply that the chief work in science done by these colleges serves to train competent teachers for elementary schools.\" Whilst this is doubtless an important part of the collegiate work, it is by no means the highest or most valuable outcom3 of the educational efforts of these institutions. To speak only for one of them, I may say that during the 30 years in which I had the honour of filling the chair of chemistry at Owens College I had the satisfaction year after year of turning out men who occupied, and still occupy, n) c. i-, yof the highest professional and commercial posts throughout the country. In fact there ip. scarcely a manufacturing concern in the North of England involving an application of chemical scieace in the scientific work is not entrusted to an Owens man.\" The high educational work done at Owens in other branches of science has also been conspicuously successful in producing men who ocoupy high positions in various colleges in this country and in the colonies as professors of physics, engineer- ing, biology, and medicine. These are the results which constitute the best proof that the work done by the University Colleges is of a character sufficiently national to warrant the extension of btate aid asked for by the deputation, provided the State can be assured that the grants th u made are legitimately employed in furthering this highest scientific education.",

Berthelot read a letter from Professor Ramsay, the co-discoverer with Lord Rayleigh of argon, giving the first announcement of another discovery of the same nature. This new gas he proposes to call crypton. The discovery was effected, like that of argon, by the aid of the spectroscope. The presence of crypton was detected by the existence in the spec- trum of a green line, which M. Berthelot saw in a minute tube containing the two-millionth of a pound which Professor Ramsay had sent with his letter. According to the description for- warded to M.Berthelot,crypton belongs,not to tbe argon but to the helium family, and its density is somewhat greater than that of oxygen. It appears to be a simple body and monamatic. For these details M. Berthelot offers the guarantee of the well-known ability of the discoverer. Professor Ramsay state* that he will collect a larger quantity of crypton for further researches, of the results of which he will give the Academy the first information. M. Berthe- lot called attention to the compliment paid to the Academy by so many Englishmen of science in salu- ting it as the medium of publicity for their discove- ries. This, he said, was an answer to the intrigues of obscure personages who tried to create a chasm between the two leading pioneers of modern science and civilisation. The effect remained to be seen on hygiene and biology of the acknowledged presence of so many substances in that atmospheric gas which we inhaled from bur first to our last breath.",

By no means the least agreeable form of this movement is the instituting of classes in some convenient edncational centre in the sum:ner months. This year the University College of Wales Aberyst- wyth, has proposed to hold classes in certain sub- jects at Aberystwyth from August 8 to 2o. The classes will Commence with an inaugural a 'dress to be delivered in the Examination Hall of the College on August 7 by Professor Ainsworth D.ivia. B.A. The subject is the very opportune one of the Edu- cational Value of Science.\" To avoid desulioriness of reading and anything approaching dilettanteism, it is proposed to divide the lectures and practical in- struction into groups, as followGroup A chemistry and agricniture theoretical chemist-y* a course of fifteen lectures by J. Alan Murray, B Sc! The same also in agriculture by Mr Murray who will also take charge of thr. e hours' laboratory practice daily. The subj-cts for Group li will be biology (botany and zoology), physiology, and hygiene. A course of fifteen lectures will b\u00b0 given w' in theoretical biology by Mr T. H. Salter, B.Sc., who will also superintend a course of three hours' prac ice daily in practical biology. In the same grL U) a course of fifteen lectures in physiology and bJ giene will be given by Mr T. P. Beddoes, M.B., F.K.C.S. Eng. Group C consists of lectures in art (inus c and drawing). A course on the theory of music (both notations), consisting also of fifteen lectures, vill be given by Mr D. Jenkins, Mus. Bac, (C niab). Fifteen lectures on practical plan\" and sol d geo- metry will be given by Mr J. Clark, who will also hold clashes tor three hours daily in freehand, model drawing, and shading. Of th, se arroup3 no student may Uke more than one. This proviso is made in order that a course of study truly educative in subjects and method, though necessarily confi- ed within a very limited period, may be offered.\" The fees will be as follows:-For a ticket admitting to any one group, \u00a31 10s. Stude; ts selecting Group A or B will be required to provide themselves with apparatus, which may, if desired, be produced through the Registrar-in Group A at a cost of 7s 6d and in Group B at a cost of 10s 6d. This apparatus it may be stated, will be of permanent use to stud. ents in their subsequent studies. Students qualified to do more advanced practical work in Group A may at their own risk, hire from the College the necessary apparatus at a charge of 5s. To ensure serious work a register of attendance will be kept in each class, while in order that this work may obtain its due reward students who have attented not less than two- thirds of the lectures and practical work oi the group to which they are attached, and who pass a satisfac- y tory examination, will be entitled to a certificate. These examinations will be held on August 26. It is also intended that the library of the Collese shall be open for the use of the students every day except Saturday, between the hours of 11 and 12 a.m. Lest '\u25a0e Pr'ees of lodgings at Aberystwyth in the height of the season should be prohibitive to many, arrange. ments have been:made for acco-nmola 'ling a e-,tain number of men students in beautifully situated Ipre- mises at an inclusive charge of .\u00a31 each per week for board, lodging, and attendance. The accommoda- tion will be allocated in order of application. It is sincerely hoped that many will avail themselves of these classes. It were a pity if the attempts at University Extension were doomed to fail from want of sufficient zeal on the part of students. Prospectuses and forms of application have already been issued for this year's summer classes, and may be obtained from the Registrar, University College of Wales. Aber. ystwyth.",

                "full_text": "LORD DERBY AT LIVERPOOL, Lord Derby has presided at the recent distribution of prizes to the students of the medical faculty Of the Liver- pool University College; and, alluding to the present position of the college, he said that during the past vear the increase in the number of day students had been so slight that it might be said to have remained practically stationary. In the number of attendances, however, the increase had been considerable, the fees had risen from L940 to L1560, and the evening classes showed a total of 1354, as against 536 in the previous year. But the most important event of the present year was the amalgamation with the college of the Royal Infirmary School of Medicine. The attitude of the two bodies in the past bad been one of friendly co-operation, and they were now virtually identified and merged in a single body, what was formerly the School of Medicine being now known as the Medical Faculty of University College. It was believed that by this fusion both the college and the school would profit, and the latter would share in the connection, not yet brought about, but in- evitable in the near future, with the Victoria University at Maachester. Looking generally at their position, he thought they had good reason to be content, though, like most young institutions, they suffered from that eternal want of pence which vexes man.\" They had two new chairs to endow, and until that was done they would not be in a position to apply for incorporation with Victoria University. Professor Herd man then delivered his address, which was mainly devoted to a vindication of the importance of biology as a portion of scientific train- ing. He said the variety and extent of medical study bad become such as to call for serious consideration. The days of the Admiral Crichton were over, and in these days, when science was broadening out and freeing herself from hampering restraints, it was clearly im- possible for any one person to keep pace with the advances that were being made in all directions. Hence, a man must be more or less a specialist if he would survive the struggle for existence. Biology was one of the subjects in regard to which, as a portion of medical training, there appeared to be some doubt in the minds of some persons, and when it was retnembered how much the medical student had to acquire, in at the most four or five years, it was not wonderful that he tried to dispense with subjects n t absolutely essential. But he would point out that the relations .between biology and medicine had undergone consider- able changes during late years, and it sgemed superfluous to insist upon the value of biological science to-medicine in an age which had witnessed the invaluable discoveries of Pasteur, Koch, and Ferrier. The professor spoke in terms of unbounded admiration of Darwin, and said happily scientists were now practically of one mind in accepting evolution in some form or another, and the main object of a biological investigation was to establish the great theory on a firmer foundation, and to arrive at some definite khowledge of its work- ing. Lord Derby expressed the great pleasure with which he had heard Professor Herdman's address, and said he had heard with satisfaction the panegyric ou Darwin, who was one of the half do en men of tha present century who would be remembered a thousand years hence. He had had the honour of knowing Darwin personally, and though great was his admiration for his work he was more impressed by his extraordinary mo- desty, and his dignified simplicity of nature. Darwin. could not help knowing he had made an epoch in the history of human thought, but never in any human being was there a more entire absence of egotism and self-asser- tion. They could all imitate him in that, although they could not imitate him in his discoveries. The prizes were then delivered, and after some complimentary votes, the proceedings terminated.",

Being an observational science it had taught men to think more accurately and to collec; facts before attempt ing to g-Mieraliz^. It was, however, as the science of evolution that biology had exercised the gre-itest influence. This principle which had been dis- covered long before D'rwin was what gave the idea of progress its present important place in modern thought. Professor Davis d-alt. in the course of his lecture with the effect of the princip'e of evolution on chemistry, astronomy, geology, psychology, anthropology, sociology, &c., and finallyon education. He closed his lecure with some practical remaiks on Welsh education. The lecture was listened throughout with the keenest interest.

Being an observational science it bad taught men to think more accurately and to collect facts before attempt- ing to g^neralisM. It was, however, as the science of evolution that biology had exercised the greatest influence. This principle which had been dis- covered long before Darwin was what gave the idea of progress its present important place in modern thought. Professor Davis dealt in the course of his lecture with the effect of the principle of evolution on chemistry, astronomy, geology, psychology, anthropology, sociology, &c., and finally on education. He closed his lecture with some pr<*ctio\u00bbl remarks on Welsh education. The lecture was listened throughout with the keenest interest. The Rector who presided announced that there would be a number of lectures delivered in the course of the winter and that it was also proposed by the Society to study a certain text book of general interest. At the close of the meet- ing a large number of new members were enrolled.",

The Secretary was called upon to read the minutes- of the last meeting, whieh were confirmed. The Principal said that he had received the re-- port of the examiners, which was very satisfactory.. It bad been presented to the Council with much ap- proval, but with their consent he would postpone reading the list until the meeting in the examination hall, to be held at three o'clock. The Chairman expressed the pleasure which they all felt at seeing Mr Stuart Rendel with them, al- though he was not a governor, but he was looking; forward to the time when- he would become one, and would be of essential assistance to them (hear, hear)<^ They all knew how much Mid-Wales was indebted to him for the endeavours which he had exercised in obtaining for Aberystwyth that which was its just right. He bad had a few opportunities of see- ing the skill and tact which he exereised during a long period, and it must be to them a source of grati- fication that his endeavours were crowned with such success (applause). Mr David Davies, M.P., who was warmly cheered, said that he had a few words to say. He was sorry that he was obliged to go with the train at 2.40 as he had to be in South Wales, and therefore could not attend the afternoon meeting. They knew very well that this was a critical time with the college^, and some friends had been urging them not to, accept anything less than \u00a34,000 from the Govern. ment, but they did not feel justified in refusing \u00a3 2,500, when they could get no more (bear, hear). He might mention that Mr Mundella had told him that it entirely rested with the people of this district and the college whether they should have the < \u00a3 4,000' or not; that if they did their work well and satis- factory to the Government\u2014in other words, if they did the same amount of work as Bangor-they should have the same grant as Bangor (applause)* He only mentioned this so that they should put their shoulders to the wheel, and do what they could. He knew that Mid-Wales was poor, but ho did not know that they were poorer than Bangor (laughter) certainly they had a few slates, but it was a bad time there now. All they had to do was to put a spurt on, and make s little effort so as to bring the amount up to the \u00a3 4,000. They were under some disadvantage, but be had beelz",

One of the largest and most complete of iiioderii educational institutions in the North of England, the Yorkshire College, which is situated at Leeds, and was opened by the Prince of Wales in July last, was last evening the scene of consider- able excitement and alarm, in consequence of a fire breaking out in the roof of that portion of the building in which is situated the chemistry lecture hall and the section devoted to the study of biology. It appears that one of the two sunlights with which the chemistry lecture-hall is lighted had been burning the greater part of the day, and that the heat from this apparatus had set fire to the false flooring which separates the hall from the biological section above. The discovery was made shortly after nine o'clock, when the fire had been smouldering for some time, but had not made much progress, owing to the solidity of the flooring. The hose connected with the establishment was brought into use, but with little effect, and even after the arrival of the corporation fire brigade but little progress was made in checking the outbreak, owing to the difficulty of reaching the seat of the fire. At last, however, three jets were brought into play. An immense amount of damage was done by the water. When the fire was discovered one of the professors was lecturing to a large audience in the chemistry lecture hall. The lecture was brought to an abrupt conclusion, and though it was feared that a panic might ensue, the large audience left the hall in an ordorly manner. A telegram despatched from Leeds at 8 a.m. this morning states that the fire at the Yorkshire College was got under at one o'clock, and no further outbreak is anticipated. The fire is believed to have originated in a sunlight in the chemical lecture hall, where a lecture was being delivered, aud was communicated to the biological lecture-room above. The damage, chiefly caused by water, will be covered by insurance, but the inconvenience and loss of time caused to students will be very considerable. The firemen are still keeping watch over the building.",

Frost in the Lochaber district has been so intense that the river Nevis was frozen over on Sunday night. A con- siderable quantity of snow has fallen. Count Beust. the Austrian Ambassador, is on a visit to the Earl and Countess of Carnarvon at Highclere Castle. It appears that the sum to be paid in January by the Berlin Municipality for the property of the Berlin Water- works Company is \u00a31,250,000, not 1:2,000,000. Major Bousfield, the Conservative candidate for Bath, was in 18C1 presented with a sword of honour and a bank cheque for \u00a31,8(\u00edO, as an acknowledgment for his services as a chief leader in the national volunteer movement. Broadlands, near Romsey, Hants, the seat of the late Lord Palmerston, and now occupied by his stepson, the Hon. W. Cowper-Temple, M.P., narrowly escaped de- struction by fire on Sunday last. At a meeting held in New castle-on-Tyne on Tuesday, \u00a33.:)()O were subscribed to a fund for the payment of the Bishop of Durham's costs in the actions now pending against him in consequence of his anti-Ritualistic action. A destructive fire broke out early on Tuesday morning in the cotton mill of Messrs. Holland and Sons, Miles Platting, Manchester. The damage is estimated at from \u00a38U,000 to \u00a3lUO,OOO. On Tuesday the trial of Marshal Bazaine was resumed. Several Generals gave evidence. General Bourbaki stated that he accepted the mission to the Empress because he thought it the best thing to do in the interests of the army.

SEA DRIFT.\u2014A post-card enclosed in a bottle from the Ulster Fisheries and Biology Association, cast adrift at Belfast, was picked up on Cefn Sidan Sands, not far i from the wreck of the Teviotdale,\" on Sunday last by Mr C. R. Lewis, Quay House, and returned by him to the address supplied. WEDDI.NG.-At Llanelly recently, Mr John James, the well-known saddler, etc at Kidwelly-a son of the late Mr L. James, of Whitland and Llanboidy-was married to Miss Ann James, daughter of Mr Levi James, Corporation Arms, Kidwelly. The wedding was of a very quiet nature. The honeymoon was spent at Caerphilly and Cardiff. REVISION CounT.-On Saturday, Mr W. Denman Benson, the revising barrister, sat at the Town-hall, Kidwelly, and revised the list of voters for the parishes of Kidwelly, St. Ishmael's, and Llandefeilog. Messrs Evan Jones, Llandyssul, and Anthony Thomas, Car- marthen, appeared for the Conservatives and Liberals respectively, but the proceedings were of a very quiet nature, no vote being contested. CAPEL SUL.-The history of this chapel, which was built in the year 1785, would, if it were possible to get it, be very interesting. The late Mr Richard Thomas, of the Cottage, had a history of it and read it at the Centenary meeting of the chapel in 1895. Perhaps Mrs Thomas, Broadlay, will look up old papers in her possession, and let us have it in the columns of the Welshman. The chapel is a daughter church, as are some eleven other chapels, of Penygraig Chapel, near Carmarthen. Capel Sul was re-opened after consider- able improvements and decoration on Sunday last. The re-opening services were throughout of a most im- pressive character and attended by huge crowds. In addition to the respected pastor, Rev. W. C. Jenkins, who has been here for nearly 40 years, the Rev. J. H. Rees (Cannel), the Rev. J. Rogers (Jerusalem), and the Rev. J. Morgan (Pontardulais), also preached. By the bye, why is the chapel called Capel Sul\" ? The well near by, which supplies the town with water, is also called \"Ffynon Sul,\" How came it by this name?",

On Thursday, last week, meetings were held at Bangor, of the Welsh Lectureship, Byelaws, and Finance Committees, and of the Council of the above college. At the Council meeting there were present Colonel the Hon W. E. Sackville- West (chairman), Mr W. A. Darbishire (vice- chairman), Mr J. R. Davies, Dr Dobbie, Mr R. A. Jones, Principal Reichel, Rev D. Rowlands, Mrs Verney, Mr Glynn Williams, and Mr Caiwaladr Davies, registrar.\u2014The reports of the Finance, Welsh Lectureship, and General Pur- poses Committee were adopted. It was resolved that a Welsh lecturer should be appointed as soon as the guarantee of \u00a3100 a year for five years is secured, it being stated that the sum already promised was 245 per annum, and it was resolved that the fees of students attending the Welsh classes should be devoted entirely towards the support of the lectureship.-It was reported that the adaptation of the west wing of the college for the purposes of the library, museum, and class- rooms was now practically completed, and a sum of \u00a3255 being based on estimates prepared and adopted by the General Purposes Committee was voted for the purpose of furnishing the same. Mr R. W. Hudson, of Chester, having resigned his seat as a member of the council, it was resolved that the filling up of the vacancy should be left to the Court of Governors. Reports from the Bye- laws Committee and the Senate were received and considered. It was resolved that the Council should proceed to appoint three representatives of the college on the joint committee to draft a charter for the Welsh University in addition to the four appointed by the Court of Governors, and that the court in October be asked to con- firm the action of the council. Lord Powis, Mr R. A. Jones, and one member to be appointed by the senate were thus added. Principal Reichel was appointed to give evidence before Lord Selborne's commission oa a teaching university for London. The usual annual grants were voted for the departments of chemistry, physics, and biology. The session will be closed to-day (Friday), when the awards will be announced, the certifi- cates distributed, and a statement made by the Principal.",

                "full_text": "THE MERMAID MYTH. In an article dealing with the mermaid myth, the Spea7tt r says that much seeking is not necessary to discover the orio-in of the story if one will only go the right way to work. Haeckel's dictum that the history of the individual is the history of the race is as true in the region of myth as it is in that of biology. Educated men and women of the present day have lost the myth-making faculty, and must go to their children, or to those whose minds are childlike, to learn whence such stories sprang and how they grew. Intercourse with the peasantry and listening to their tales would teach one much. But they must not be questioner1, or they will be startled into sudden silence. A good listener in a village would hear tales the counterparts ot which might be found in Theocritus, who but gave permanent form to folk-tales current in his time. Then the classics lie ready to our hands: and for Hebrew folklore, there is more of it than most people wot of in The Book, which is in truth a library or a literature. But these should be read as colours should be mixed\u2014 with brains. And that is not an easy task. If,lhowever, we must have literature-in plain words, if we are to enter into other men's labours\u2014Kingsley's \"Water Babies\" will give us all we want. There are land babies, I why not water babies? Voila tout.\" It is not mucn ot a secret-the s)urce of this mermaid myth\u2014even as he states it at length. No water babies, indeed ? Why, wise men of old said that everything on earth had its double in the water; and you may see that that is, if not quite true, still quite as true as most other theories which you are likely to hear for many a day.\" How deep a hold this fancy took of early naturalists may be seen from their works and traces of it still linger in such names as sea-lion and sea- bear,\" though the reason for such names has long been forgotten by many of those wTho use them. Hence it is clear that the mermaid of folk-tale has no kinship with siren or sea- nymph, and certainly none with fish-shapec1 gods. The dugong and the manatee were probably taken by early man as proving the existence of man-like beings living in the sea; they did not give rise to the idea.",

                "full_text": "-\u2666 RESPONSIBILIY AND INHERITANCE. In the case of the two boys tried at Crewe the other day lor parricide, their counsel (the British Medical Journal says) suggested to the jury that they should not be accounted \"guilty,\" or at least that their blood- guiltiness should be regarded with very considerable leniency, on the ground that they were more or less, if not wholly, irresponsible, because of their souls' inherited furnituie of passions and tempers. \"What,\" said the advocate, in effect\" could you expect of the children of such a father?\" Now, no doubt the father's ill- conditionedness was abundantly proved; but the first biological reflection upon such a plea would be that the alleged inheritance from the father was extremely problematical. A very little knowledge of even very popular biology would remind us how heredity often jumps a generation or two, and consequently how little ground there was for the assumption for the defence. As thrown out. it was no more than an unproved and quite a priori possibility* At present it is enough to note that the presence in the subject of the law of the discernment of good and evil, right and wrong, as these are by inveterate custom reckoned in the given Bociety, is what constitutes him responsible. This absent, he is irresponsible; this present in consciousness, no matter what else is present or absent, he is responsible. Evil tendencies, passions, tempers, may abound in the same consciousness with this discernment to a degree that almost overwhelms it; but if it is not quite submerged and sunk below the limit of consciousness, responsibility remains. The existence of an evil nature, then, whether inherited or acquired, whether first or second nature, is totally irrelevant to the question of responsibility. The letter of Richard Davies, written three weeks before his trial, shows that he, at least, was not devoid of responsibility in this lower, ordinary and juristic sense, if, indeed, it does not evince, a still deeper responsibility. In an evil hour I was tempted and overpowered to do wrong.\" \"May the Lord help it to be proved truly at the trial, and may I meet my punishment bravely!\" Brave words! Conscientious words! Words evincing I nooraldiscernment.. ,9Vch proofs of responsibility a* are involved and implied in these deliberately written words, the medical witness and alienist will do well to furnish himself when he is solemnly called upon in the witnest-box, and, in a matter of lifa or death, give an expert and authoritative opinion.",

The man in the street knows n'othing of the mysteries of the Socialist camp, but to one who is initiated into the views of the contending factious the subscripti'an, \"Social Demo- crat,\" explains all, and, as our Gallic neigh- bours say, \"To know all is to pardon all.\" The Social Democrats are the oldest and least effective of the wings of the Socialist army. The S.D. Peer is usually a very good fellow himself, an out and out Social- ist (as he conceives Socialism), very often a vegetarian, a non-smoker, an abstainer from alcohol and, to these virtues, he often adds anti-vaccination, anti-vivisection, ae make-weights. In fact, our S.D. Peer is the N on conformist of the Socialist party, the PuTitan of the movement, although he ) is not above striking a bargain with the despised Liberal or Tory, when occasion serves. But, alas! his Socialist and ethical creeds are German importations, imported long ago, and. apparently, resemble flies in amber, because they have undergone no evolution. The Social Democrat talks glibly of evolution in biology and sociology, but, strange to say, believes in revolution- ary Socialism. He is great on the mater- talistic conception of history, and Tacks his brain to find parallels between Anglicanism and Landlordism, Nonconformity and Cap- italism, and, to be quite logical as he nn- I derstands the matter, between Agnosticism and Socialism. He dotes upon watchwords, and fondles catchwords with the admira- I tion of a parent for its darling. He is I proud of his \"eoonomic basis,\" although he is not always very sure as to where or what that baifris is; and, when pursued by the I practicai demands of his I.L.P. comrades, takes refuge in his \"ultimates.\" In short, Mr. Editor, our Social Demo- crat is not nearly the terrible fellow he would have us think him to be; and since he fails to see that each nation must work out its own political and racial salvation in its own way, he is an almost negligible fac- tor in British Socialism, which, on the whole, follows the method of constitutional political acti'on without concerning itse-li over-much with wiredrawn arguments about academic questions, and certainly does not cast aspersions upon anyone's re- ligious beliefs. Finally, a large proportion of Mr Til Lett's votes were cast, not for Mr. Tillett, but for Labour and Socialism, II I in spite of Mr. Tillett.",

                "full_text": "THE PUBLIC HEALTH. The annual report for 1889 of the medical-omoer to the Local Government Board has just been issued. It contains the usual facts concerning the administra- tion of the Vaccination Acts, the returns gf vaccina- tion under review being those for 1887. The pro- portion of children born in 1887 and not finally aoeounted for as vaccinated or dead is in the metropolis 9*0 per cent. of births, and in the rest of England and Wales 6-7 per oent., the latter being the highest default since 1872, and the former having only once been exceeded since that year\u2014 namely, in 1875, when the percentage wasV\"3. That the Vaccination Acts are very unevenly enforced is shown by the individual union and county returns reproduced in the volunie. The oounties of Hunt- ingdon, Rutland, Westmoreland, Brecknock, Carnar- von, Merioneth, and Montgomery show less than 3 per cent. of default, while Bedford records 14:5, Northampton 13*9, and Leicester 34*1 per cent. Then again, while many union returns point to losses ot less than three per cent, Gloucester has 58*8, Oldham 44-1, Leicester .72-2, Eastbourne, 32-2, and Keighley 75 4 per cent. of default. Tie volume con- tains also the more important reports of the inspectors of the Medical Department on inquiries conducted during 1889 into actual prevalences of epidemic diseases and the like. Appendix JJ is devoted to the reports made to the department by Dr. Klein and otner scientific workers, dealing with '\u25a0 the biology of diphtheria, food poisoning by pork and gravy, bacteria in relation to digestive processes, and the chemistry of bacterial growth. The further oon- j tribution to the stilogy of diphtheria is of especial interest, showing, as it does, the effect on milch cows and their milk, and on calves, of inoculation with the bacterial \u2022 growth of diphtheria, and also the relations of the cat to the disease in the human sob- ject. This report by Dr. Klein is rendered the more striking by the 38 plates of illustrations, with their 75 separate figures and explanatory notes which im- \u25a0 mediately follow it.",

                "full_text": "THE SOUTH WALES COLLEGE A meeting of the council of the University College for South Wales and Monmouthshire was held at Cardiff on Monday afternoon. Dr. Edwards presided, and the otiiers present were\u2014 the principal (Professor V. Jones), Dr. Rees (Swansea), Messrs J. Duncan, Lewis Williams, U. C. Thompson, J. Cory, L. Daniel (Merthyr), Dr. Roberts (Pontypridd) Revs. A. Tilly, N. Thomas, C. Jones, and J. D. Watters. The minutes of the previous meeting having been confirmed, a letter was read from Lord Aberdare stating that he would be happy to join the vice- president and the principal in taking the neces- sary steps in bringing before the City Guilds In- stitute the need of technical education in South Wales, and to petition them to endow a chair of mechanical engineering. A letter was also read from Lord Aberdare, of a later date, stating that he had forwarded to Lord Cariing- ford the excellent letter of the council\u2014excellent in tone and substance\u2014in answer to Lord Oar- lingford's letter on the question of the constitution of the council, &c.\u2014A very important and lengthy report was submitted by the scholarship commit- tee in respect to the foundation of scholarships\u2014 entrance, honour, and exit. The proposed scholar- ships are of various classes, and are intended to meet the needs of South Wales in so far as higher education is concerned. The report was in part adopted and in part referred back to the committee for further consideration. It was also resolved to give instructions to the organising committee to take the necessary steps to carry out the scholarship scheme in so far as it was resolved on. The finance committee pre- sented its report on the best method of dealing with the finances of the college, and it was resolved that, subject to Sir Hussey Vivian's approval, the report be adopted. The question of the ap- pointment of professors led to a lengthened discussion, and it was ultimately re- solved that a committee be appointed to draw up advertisements inviting applications for the following professorships, lectureships, and demonstratorships :-Professorships Greek, at a salary of \u00a3300; Latin, \u00a3300; mathematics, \u00a3300; logic and moral philosophy, j6300 literature and history, \u00a3300; chemistry, \u00a3300; biology, \u00a3300. Lectureships: Welsh, \u00a3100; French, \u00a350; German, \u00a350; music, \u00a3100. Demonstratorships: physics, \u00a3120; chemistry, \u00a3120.-0n the motion of Dr. Rees, it was resolved to defer the filling up of the Celtic chair for 12 months at least and the filling up of the chairs of geology, coal mining, and practical engineering was also deferred.\u2014It was resolved that Lord Aberdare be requested to give the inaugural address on October 1st.",

                "full_text": "MERTHYR. The County Court business this week is more than usually heavy, there being nearly 1,200 plaints. It has occupied the whole six days, but as the defended cases only began on Thursday we cannot give any report till our next issue. An inquest was held at the Royal Oak, Incline Top, of the Taff Vale Railway, on the 21st, before G. Overton, Esq., coroner, over the body of Will Richards, aged twenty-seven. E. Owen, a fellow workman, said that seven of them were at work in a tunnel, when a stone fell from the top and killed deceased on the spot. It was intended to arch over the place, but the stone had been tried that morning and was thought quite safe. The gorger (gaffer) told them there was no danger. Verdict, \"Accidental death.\" Another inquest was held at the same time and place over the body of E. Rawlings, who had his leg broken on the 10th by a tram passing over it.' The limb was amputated, but he never recovered the shock, and died on the 19th. Verdict, \"Accidental death.\" Edgar Poe, in one of his thrilling fictions, gives an account of a man who, being magnetised at the point of death, remained suspended in that horrible condition for some time at the will of the operator. So the admirers of Dumas have seen how Balsame kept a young lady suspended in the mesmeric state by mere accident for a long period, and not twelve months ago in Merthyr there was, it is said, a similar case of suspended faculty and volition, which was at length cured by a professor of electro-biology. So much for an introduction to Miss Montague's per- formances, some of which go far to make us believe anything of the powers of magnetism on the human frame. She claims to possess sovereign power over the human will, moulding it at her slightest pleasure to any manifestations of faculty inherent or acquired. And really the ludicrous scenes witnessed in the Town-hall go far to render her claim legitimate. If she is so clever we do not see why her services should not be secured by the public functionaries who have to deal with civil and criminal law. Doubtless in her plastic hands the debtor could be screwed up to concert pitch without the county court machinery, while a few of her magic passes would allay all those. quarrels which give Mr. Fowler so much trouble.",

The tender of Messrs Turner and Sons, of Cardiff, for \u00a31,281 for tho erection of new premises for the accommodation of the departments of physics, chemistry, and biology was accepted.\u2014A letter was read from Mr Butcher, secretary to the Brecon County Scholarship Fund, enclosing resolutions passed at a meeting ot the subscribers on the 25Gh November with re\u00eeerence to the scholarships proposed to be established in con- nection with the college. They were to the effect that the counc I should fix the maximum age of the students that the scholarships should be open to males only; that the subscribers adhered to a previous resolution; that the students must have been 10 years resident in the county that, as suggested by the council, there be two scholarships of \u00a320 each. The subscribers also affirmed that it was not desirable that the two scholarships should be competed for in the same year, and a third scholarship would be started two years hence to prevent the double competition taking place at the same time. Under the ex- ceptional circumstances of the first examination, the Brecknock boys already studying in the college to be allowed to compete for the proposed scholarships should they fulfil the necessary re- quirements. The council resolved that the first examination should take place about the end of the Christmas vacation.\u2014The library and appara- tus committee reported that presents of books to the college library had been received from Earl Powis, Professor Parker (London), Messrs MacMillan and Co., the Rev. E. W. Evans, Miss Eleanor Roberts, and Messrs W. Gow (Welsh National Society) and T. J. Dyke, the gift of the last named being a valuable one, as it will form the nucleus of a medical library. A grant of J355 was made to the chemical labora- tory, to include the cost of apparatus for experiments in electric lighting.\u2014On the motion of the Chairman, seconded by Principal Jones, the following resolution was passed\u2014\" That this meeting learns with great satisfaction that the health of the President (Lord AberdarA), so seriously affected by the untoward accident which lately befel him is such as to relieve all the anxiety for some time felt by the college and by the whole country.

Miss Poole, who has been starring it with such success in the Welsh counties, arrived in Merthyr last week, ibut her ferformances do not appear to have attracted many until the astonishing rumours which were spread abroad by those who did attend drew full houses. On Tuesday night there was a large audi- ence, and the feats performed elicited the greatest astonishment. One of the most thrilling periods in the evening was that when she informed her audience that she was about to exercise the influence of her will in compelling a few among them to come on the platform. This she did. You saw a keen-eyed lady, with very little of the sorceress about her, gazing sternly at the crowd before, and hey, presto young and middle-aged jumped and tumbled over seats, and rolled down the gallery steps, never halting until they stood on the platform, where the modern en-\" ohantress at once made them go through an ordeal of the most exciting character, showing that their feelings, tastes, etc., etc., were entirely in her power, and could be varied just as she wished. At the pre- vious entertainment a Plyrpouth workman was mes-\" merised, and after the 6perator had inquired where le worked, she told him that at a certain hour on Tuesday night he must attend at the Temperance Hall. No, he replied, he could not do that by any means he was obliged to work that night. She was un- movable-he rnust come and thus the matter ended. Tuesday evening, the workman, a well known and igtelligent young man, left Merthyr for Plymouth an his usual hour, and bad reached his work, a mile ant a half from Merthyr, and laboured some time, whed to the astonishment of his fellow-workmen, he was seen to throw down his tools, and, bare-headed dash away in the direction of Merthyr. The hour had come, and the will of the operator was at work, Nearing the town, he came suddenly on a young man of his acquaintance, who shouted out, 1; Where are you going at that pace ?\" The reply was a knock- down blow, and, without stopping, the man at the top of his speed reached the Hail, and rushed in and upon the platform There can be no doubt of this fact, nor of its being any other than strictly bona fide. We need not add that this conclusive evidence \"of the power of Miss Poole brought down the house.\"",

(John Murray), find the following passage, in, which the author sums up his conclusions: Writing as a, hard-shell Darwinian evolu- tionist, a lover of the scalpel and mkroscope, and of patient, empirical observation, as one who dislikes all forms of supernatural-ism, and who does not shrink from the implica- tions even of'the phrase that thought ie a secretion of the brain as bile is a, secretion of the liver, I assert as a biological fiact that the moral law is as real and as external to rilan as the starry vault. It has no secure seat in any single man or in \u25a0any single nation. It ie the work of the blood and tears of long generations of men. It is not in man inborn or innate, but is enshrined in his traditions, in his customs, in his literature and his reli- gion. Its creation and sustenance are the crowning glorv of man, and his consciousness of it puts him in a high place above the animal world. Men live and die, nations rise m w end fall, but the struggle of individual lives and of individual nations must be nleasured not by their immediate needs, but as they tend to the debasement or perfection of man'a great achievement. nie m1:m np my argument. It is assorted that war is juet, necessary, and admirable, and that this proposition is a deduction from biology. In the words of von Bernhardi: Wherever we look in Nature we find that war is a fundamental law of development. This great verity which has been recognised in past ages, has been convincingly demon- strated in modern times by Charle-s Darwin.\" I hope to have succeeded; in showing: 1. That even if the struggle for existence were a scientific law, it does not necessarily apply to human affairs. 2. That modern nations are not units of the same order as the units of the animal and vegetable kingdom, from which the taw of struggle for existence is a supposed inference. .1 TVirtl +1'1..0.

                "full_text": "i- SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS. A great deal of useful work has been done in the course of the year in various departments of science. Among the most immediately use- ful investigations are those into the introduc- tion of arsenic into various articles of human consumption. This has been traced amongst other sources to impure sulphuric acid used in the manufacture of glucose, and to anthracite and coke used in the preparation of various fcocl stuffs. Dr. Koch has thrown welcome doubt nr a theory which has long been troubling lis, namely, that tuberculosis can be transmitted to man by the milk or the beef of an infected cow. The metal aluminium is slowly pressing forward, and proving itself useful in new and important ways. Aerial navigation has made distinct progress, M. Santos Dumont having successfully steered his air ship from St. Cloud round the Eiffel Tower and back. Wireless telegraphic apparatus has been fitted to Atlantic liners, and the Campania and Lucania have been able to communicate in mid-ocean, though quite out of sight of one another. A terribly costly lesson has been taught us in the matter of the construction of torpedo boat destroyers, and even more costly lesons have been learnt in military science, and a great im- petus given to invention, through the war. A most important conflict, big with consequences for the future of electric traction, has been that between the champions of direct and polyphase current for the underground railway in London, now decided in favour of the former. The seismograph, hitherto used simply to record earthquake shocks, has been shown to be capable of indicating Santos Dumont sailing over Paris. atmospheric disturbances at a considerable dis- tance, and so obtains a new value as a weather prophet. In pure science also much work has been done which, however, is apt to be of less general interest than that of a more practical nature. In biology and botany new species have bee a discovered, some filling important gaps in the evolutionary order. Some interest- ing speculations as to the relations of-the de- velopment of the; .bra in and the shape of the Skull have been called forth by extensive head measurements conducted mainly by Frenchmen. Lord Kelvin has suggested a theory which in- dicates that the total amount of matter in the universe may be about equal to 1,000,000,000 times that contained in our sun. Professor G. Forbes suggests the existence of a large planet beyond Neptune. Interesting information as to the pre-Grecian and other old inhabitants of Crete has been obtained by excavations in that island, and the Antarctic regions are being invaded by British and German expeditions acting in co-operation.",

Manganese is now in great demand. OBITUARY. We regret to record the death of Mr Robert Jones, The Cottage, Llanfair, a native of Llwynon, close to this town. Decased had been engaged as a sailor, almost without a break, for a period of 43 years, and amongst those following the same occupation he was held in high esteem. The remains were buried in Llanfair churchyard. FREE CHURCHES.\u2014 A united meeting of the Sunday Schools of the Free Churches of the town was held on Sunday afternoon at Caersalem Chapel, under the presidency of the Rev Arberth Evans (B) in the absence of the Rev D Jones (W). Addresses were delivered by the Revs J Gwynoro Davies, Zachanah Mather, W farri Hughes, and E Jones, Messrs W J Morris, and Lewis Lewis. Particular reference was made to the fact that a large number of the young men of the town never attended Sunday School and preferred ',o walk about rather than go to places of worship. EVOLUTION.\u2014Before the members of the Bar- mouth Literary and Scientific Society on Thursday evening, Professor Ainsworth Davies, of Aber- ystwyth College, delivered a lecture on Biology and its influence on modern thought.\" The address was a learned one, and a hearty vote of thanks was passed to Professor Davies for his kindness in coming over to deliver it. Twenty-one new mem- bers were enrolled during the evening, and the society promises to do a great deal of good for the town. The Rector (Rev E Hughes) occupied the chair. BUILDING.-Several new buildings are in course of erection in this town, and not for a long time have builders been busier than of late. It appears as if the town is just commencing a very successful periol in its history. It is to be regretted that the shops known as the Arches, as well as several houses in other parts of the town are not occupied. The impression that the rates in the town are over 10s in the \u00a3 is entirely groundless.",

Their voices were well- balanced, and their rendering was charming in every respect, as was evinced by the en- core they duly received. Albert Gordon Davies greatly amused the audience by his careful and detailed anaylsis of the nursery rhyme \"Mother Hubbard,\" and by the moral lessons he deduced from it. The part son \"Down where the bluebells grow,\" sounded sweetly from the lips of Hannah Moore Jones, Nesta Howell, Morgan David Mor- gan, Charles Lewis, Willie George Lloyd, John Lloyd Jones and Samuel Davies. Harold Evans and Albert Lewis by their representa- tion of the farce \"Mr. Jones' Christmas Pre- sent,\" effected much laughter, and the local touches were well appreciated. Great praise is due to Mr. Williams, B.A. for his energy and devoiedness in coaching the pup- ils for their respective parts, and the all- round excellence of the entertainment show efl how thorough and painstaking the train- ing had been. Dr. Davies referred to the leaving of Mr. Robson, B.Sc. to take up duties as lecturer in Biology at the Leyton Institute. He was only expressing the opinion of all present when he said that the school and town would greatly miss the valuable services of Mr. Robson. Mr. Rob- son addressed the meeting in a brief speech. Harold Evans, on behalf of the !ithla;ic6 of the school, concisely commented on Mr HoL- son's energy and enthusiasm as trainer of the football team. John Morgan Jones who who follows Mr. Robson in the secretaryship and treasurership oft he football club spoke to the same effect. Then the audi- ence joined in singing \"For he is a ju:ly good fellow.\" Mr. Robson left with the b.t wishes of numerous friends and acquaintances. The proceedings were drawn to a el,)se by the rendering of the part song \"We -)t!k away on the billows gay,\" by the school choir under the conductorship of the Headwater, and the singing of \"God Save ohe King\" by the audience.",

TO TU: EDJTon OF THE WF.STERX MAIL.\" SIR,\u2014It is a rh-ky matter f<T a correspondent to enter the lists with the editor, but the fairness with which you usually treat those who differ from you emboldens me to make a few remarks on your loader to-day on the University College of Cardiff. I fail to see from a perusal of the report ia another part of the paper a justification of the remarks you make at the beginning of the article. I refer to the following:\u2014\"Tho ceremony of distributing prizes was performed in the presence of \"gathr- ing which was in itself a striking testimony to the deep interest which is felt by all classes in the development of th. Welsh educational I1IOyemoDt. Etr!1 sect and parly of the cmiimnnity was upTe. sented at the me. ttny,\" 1 have looked carefully over the list of the names of those who were present and cannot find the name of a single Conservative, except Lord Windsor, and he cannot bo considered a part of the\" Ratliering.\" Lord Aberdare and the Vicar of St. John's were the only Churchmen that were present. The others con- sisted of Cardiff Radicals and Nonconformists. My remarks do not apply to the professors. The only member of the C.,diff Council present ws Aldennn Lewip, and the ether public bodies of the town were unrepresented. The college is described AS the University of Soullt Walci and Monmouthshire. One looks in vain for the names of men representing any part of the district outside of Cardiif. I confine myself to facts, and fail to see evidence of the \"deep interest\" you refer to. Neither can I see evidence of the interest taken in IhdCollege by the youth of South Wales. All the graduates to whom prizes were given yesterday are English women and English men. The chief frizes in Greek, Latin, psychology and ethics. English, malhenwtics, and biology were won by students from England. Someone may infer froui this state of things that Welsh students are inferior to English. That is not the explanation, for manv Welshmen have distinguished them- selves at the English and Scotch universities since the Cardiff College was established. I cannot see what advantage is to be gained by pulli ng up the cIIllege at the expense of truth nnd established facts. The college is doing excellent work of an elementary and preparatory kind, and will do more when the tcchni .1 branch is in full opera- tion, but it is neither popular in South Wales nor successful as a university.\u2014I ain, &:0\" Cardiff, Jan. 15.

                "full_text": "NATIONAL WEED CAMPAIGN. I Sir,\u2014May I, on behalf of my committee, ask for the support of your readers in a national campaign which we are maugurating against weeds? We know the adequate supply of food is of vital importance to the people of this coun- try, and it will be readily admitted that the most practical way of increasing our home production is to see that we raise the highest possible yields off the area now sown, or about to be sown, with different crops. Among the different factors hos- tile to the food producer, our plant enemies, the weeds, are the greatest and most regular source of loss. Experiments made abroad and confirm- ed by similar tests made in England showed that one weed alone, charlock, accounted for a reduc- tion of 50 per cent. in the yield of oats, but, in- deed, the statement that weeds cause a loss, which throughout the whole of the country must reach enormous proportions, requires no proof to anyone who has even cultivated only a garden patch. Modern biology teaches us that, in theory, all this vast loss of valuable food is pre- ventable. In practice, therefore, we shall be suc- cessful in the eradication of weeds, and, conse- quently, the increase of our crops, in proportion to our ability to devise cheap and practical means of destroying weeds. Ireland, the Isle of Mah, and the Colonies seek to attain the object by means of Weed Acts. Here, we believe, that in times like these, when everyone is eager to ren- der service, great success may be achieved by voluntary effort. We need, first of all, men or women who will undertake in their districts to act as local honorary secretaries and organisers, and, in the second place, we shall need the help of everyone of your readers who feels that he ought to do his share in destroying the useless to give elbow room to the useful, and so increase our store of food. The 13 prescribed weeds are Thistle, dock, bindweed, dandelion, couch, char- lock, buttercup, chickweed. daisy, groundsel, coltsfoot, poppy and nettle. I shall be pleased to send full particulars to any of your readers ap- plying for it, and enclosing a stamped addressed envelope.\u2014I am, &c., T. J.

At the Congress of Hygiene and Demography re- cently held in Madrid, Dr. Behring announced that, as the result of experimental work with the toxin and anti-toxin of tuberculosis, he had isolated a substance from the tubercle bacillus 100 times more powerful than Koch's tuberculin, and had obtained, by passing the virus through a horse, an anti-toxin which is be- lieved to be an efficient cure for the disease. Experi- ments on a large scale are to be carried out at the Berlin Veterinary University. Dr. A. Calmette, of the Pasteur Institute of Lille, demonstrated in a highly successful manner the prophylactic effect on snake-bitten patients of serum of the blood of horses subjected to small doses of the venom. For this pur- pose a rabbit was injected with a large dose of a mix- ture of venom of the cobra, naja, ani bothrops this proved fatal in 20 minutes. Two mbbits were then injected with the protective serum, and in 10 minutes each received a dose of the mixture equal in amount to that which killed the first rabbit. These rabbits appeared to suffer no ill effects. Further experi- ments gave unquestionable evidence as to the prophylactic property of the serum, which is easily prepared and retains its protective power for an in- definite period. Great interest was evinoed in the paper read by M. Noeard, of the Alfort Veterinary School, and delegate of the French Academy of Medi- cine, describing a method of cultivating the microbe of pleuro-pneumonia of cattle, the demonstration of which had baffled the efforts of bacteriologists for nearly half a century. It is hoped that the discovery of the specific microbe and the power of cultivating it for indefinite periods, independent of animals suffering from the disease, will afford the means of providing an effectual, protective vaccine at all times available when necessity for preventive inoculation may occur. Among the most novel suggestions for the S,plication of bacteriological science were those of r. E. VaMin, of the French Academy of Medicine, who drew attention to the existence of saltpetre on the walls of dwelling-houses, and its ill-effect on the health of the dwellers therein. Dr. Vallin states that the salt is produced by nitrifying bacilli, and indi- cates that the prevention and cure are to be effected by removal of conditions favourable to their life and development. Mortar should be mixed with germi- cides, as coal-tar, sulphate of copper, &c., and where disease of the walls exist, the cure should be effected by inoculation of the walls with anti-nitrifying bacilli, -.Yat,ure.",

A deputation, headed by Mr. Love Jones-Parry, M.P., and consisting of representatives from four counties in North Wales and four counties in South Wales waited upon the council, on Tuesday, to bring before it the resolutions passed at the conference the previous evening. Messrs. Lewis Pugh Pugh, M.P.; J. Jenkins, Llanidloes; Llewelyn Lloyd, Wrexham; John Evans, Carnarvon; Revs. T. J. Wheldon, Festiniog Aaron Davies, chairman of the Bedwellty School Board and D. Thomas, Newport, having spoken in favour of the resolutions, Lord Aberdare, president of the council, in reply, ex- pressed the gratification it gave them, who had been so long engaged in conducting the operations of the college, to hear all representative men from various parts of Wales speaking so highly of what the college has done for the Principality and expressing a strong desire to have it maintained. As regards that request he was sorry they could not give a more clear and explicit answer; but he might say the majority, the great majority of the council, were in favour of supporting their resolutions so far as the continuance of the college was concerned. After a vote of thanks to the council and Lord Aberdare, the deputation retired. In the afternoon a meeting of the constituents and governors of the college was held, presided over by Lord Aberdare. Lord Aberdare was re-elected president for the coming year, and the following gentlemen were added to the list of governors :-Lewis Pugh Pugh, M.P.; Edward Davies, J. P. (Llandinam); E. R. Russell (the Daily Post, Liverpool); John Evans (the Herald, Carnarvon); and John Jenkins (Llanidloes). Messrs. Parry and Pugh, M.P.'s, were elected vice-presidents. Messrs. David Davies, M.P., &nd Stephen Evans were elected treasurers Mr. Brough, of Cambridge, was appointed professor of logic and moral philosophy. The appointment of a Welsh professor and assistant lecturer in biology will be made forthwith. It has been decided by the council to offer the following scholarships and exhibitions January next:\u2014 \u00a3 20, open to all; \u00a325, offered by Mr. Pugh, M.P.; \u00a3 25, offered by the Hon. Griffith Evans, of India; four exhibitions of \u00a315 each, offered by the council, and two of \u00a310 each by the council.\u2014Mr. Davies, M.P., proposed, and Mr. Jones-Parry, M.P., seconded, a vote of thanks to the president, which was carried with applause. Lord Aberdare acknowledged in suitable terms. The college now contains 65 students. Mr. David Davies, M.P., has promised to subscribe \u00a3 500 annually for the next six years in support of the institution.",

The whole number of days in which Easter must fall is 35. The earlist possible day on which it can fall is the 22nd of March. In the year 1818 it fell on that day, and cannot again happen on that day until the year 2285. The latest possible day on which this Christian festival can fall is the 25th of April. To know the incidence of Easter Day is of importance to the almanack makers, if to nobody else, as upon this feast depend the moveable feasts, law terms, circuits of the judges, and all the principal race meetings. The day on which it must fall is settled by Act of Parliament (14 Charles II.) and the rubric of the Church. This Act gives the rubric the force of law by joining the enactment of the prayer book in these matters to the Act. The question, Why should not Easter always fall on the same day I\" has, no doubt, often suggested itself to the young mind, while relieving the tedium of a long sermon by reading. the leaves prefixed to the Book of Common Prayer, and probably many well- educated people do not understand the reason why Easter is a moveable feast. The reason is that it was the object of those who fixed the day for the celebration of Easter to avoid the moon being at the full on the Sunday on which the offices for the Resurrection were performed. This result is secured in England by the Ecclesiastical Canon and by Act of Parliament.",

They arrived at the island on Saturday, after a spinning sail down from Garth in the J^onuie Doon,\" the small yacht belonging to the istitution, and found that tbe new keeper,Mr. T' oinas Jarrett, and his wife, had been busy for some days whitewashing and clean- ing the station within and without, and had introduced several much-needed improvements in the household arrangements. This particular expedition to the island was made :partly for the purpose of collecting certain special aniwals and seaweed, and partly in order to establish the new keeper in his place, and give him full directions for making collections and taking observations during the winter. Certainly the biologists have never before been so comfortably housed at Puffin. The arrangements in regard to board and lodging are as satisfactory as could well be in such a delightfully isolated spot, where everything, from a sack of coals to a pot of butter, has to be brought from Bangor, if not further, landed when possible on the rocks or the shingle, and conveyed on one's own back, or the donkey's\u2014usually the former-up a cliff, and over half-a-mile of island top, consisting chiefly of long grass, limestone rocks, and awkwardly placed rabbit holes, before it reaches the biological station. The new sleeping bunks, fixed in three tiers of two each against th9 wall of one of the rooms, are found to be a great im- provement on the camp beds, especially in cold weather: and a long fixed work-table, with some shelving, has converted another room into a most useful indoors laboratory, where work can be carried on at night and on very cold days, when the outside laboratory, with its stone floor and many windows, is too uncomfort- able, even for the enthusiast.",

Fishbourne to the living of Newtown, Mont., referred to the continuity of the Church of England, a title which was legally and histori- cally continuous from ancient times. They recognised, as they ought to do, every atom of genuine faith in others, but it would be un- reasonable to apply that conception of a com- plete historical church to those who had separated themselves from the Church's worship, and whose boast was that they had been founded in modern times by this or that man whose name they bad adopted as their title. With respect to the intellectual mission of the Church, how important it was\u2014especially in towns like that, where the population was vigorous, enterprising, and industrious\u2014that the people should be taught to think for them- selves, and not to let newspapers or political leaders do their thinking for them. It was dangerous to touch the question of politics, but why should it be so ? Politics was the science of legislation, and surely exact and accurate knowledge was needed here as much as any- where. They ought to be able to treat great! political questions with something of the wisdom, calmness, forbearance, and the earnest searching after truth which marked the study: of all great scientific questions. He did not think that biology, chemistry, or any other science would make much progress if it were represented by two rival parties, each striving, I not after truth, but merely to checkmate each other. Without entering into party politics at all, there was much work to be done in purify- ing the political atmosphere of the country, in teaching men to think for themselves, and to approach political questions, not in prejudice or partisanship, but in a Christian spirit. On the question of amusement, he approved of cricket and football, and said that anything which pro- duced strong muscle and steady nerve was a work which the Church of England ought to promote.",

                "full_text": "SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS. A great deal of useful work has been done 1D the course of the year in various depart- ments of science. Among the most im- mediately useful investigations are those into the introduction of arsenic into various articles of human consumption. This has been traced amongst other sources to impure sulphuric acid used in the manufacture of glucose, and to anthracite and coke used in the preparation of various food stuffs. Dr. Koch has thrown welcome doubt upon a theory which has long en troubling us, namely, that tuberculosis can be transmitted to man by the milk or the beef of an infected cow. The metal aluminium is slowly press- ing forward, and proving itself useful in new and important ways. Aerial navigation has made distinct progress, M. Santos Dumont having successfully steered his air ship from St. Cloud round the Eiffel Tower and back. Wireless telegraphic apparatus has been fitted to Atlantic liners, and the Campania and Lucania have been able to communicate in mid-ocean, though quite out of sight of onelanotber. A terribly costly lesson has been taught its in the matter of the con- struction of torpedo boat destroyers, and r'2 even more costly lessons have been learnt in military science, and a great impetus given to invention, through the war. A most important conflict, big with consequences for the future of electric traction, has been that between the champions of direct and poly- phase current for the underground, now decided in favour of tho former. In pure science also much work has been done which, however, is apt to be of less general interest than that of a more practical nature. In biology and botany new species have been discovered, some filling important gaps in the evolutionary order. Some interesting j speculations as to the relations, of the de- velopment of the brain and the shape of tho sku!! have been called forth by extensive head measurements conducted mainly by Frenchmen. Lord Kelvin has suggested a theory which indicates that the total amount of matter in the universe may be about equal to 1,000,000,000 times that contained in our sun. Professor G. Forbes suggests the existence of a large planet beyond Neptune. Interesting infoTTnation as to the pre-Grecian and other old inhabitants of Crete has been obtained bv excavations in that island, and the Antarctic regions are being invaded by British and German expeditions acting in co-operaticn.",

                "full_text": "PUFFIN ISLAND BIOLOGICAL 1 STATION. THIS marine station continues in full working order, and has been largely taken advantage of by students during the summer. Besides those from Liverpool University, several students from London, Manchester and Chester have worked there during their recess, some of the results of whose labours will be laid before the Liverpool Biological Society during the coming winter. Several professors and teachers of biology have also visited the station, including Professor Ilerdman, of Liverpool; Professor Phillips, of Bangor; Mr. Hurst, of Owens College, &c. Mr. Rutherford, the curator, sem g weekly reports to the Liverpool Marine Biological Committee of all the work done; also daily reports as to wind, weather, &c. The recent reports show that the weather has been very favourable for shore collecting, the abundance of rocky pools disclosed during low water at each end of the island rendering it a peculiarly valu- able locality in this respect. The profusion of Iciminaria and other forms of algas which clothe the rocks in such abundance form the home of numerous amphipoda, isopoda, and other crustacean life, which are separated as the fronds are agitated in fresh water. The tow-net has been brought into active requisition during the late fine weather with the best results. Mr. -1. C. Thompson, who has special charge of this department, and to whom the tow-netting material is regularly sent, reports a number of rare and valuable captures of microscopical forms, especially during several recent night hauls. Amongst other things Mr. Thompson has found Euterpe gracilis, Pontella Wollcistoni, and Li/clops Tujjini, three rare Copepoda, almost confined apparently in Britain to the water round^ Puffin Island. Professor Ilerdman has aiSO just. found Lichomolgus sabellce, a new species of Copepod first found a year ago at Beaumaris. The lovely irridescent Plettrabrachia has also been abundant about the surface and taken in the tow-net, and with it a few specimens of Tomopteris in the night hauls. Ceratium tapis and other Peridinea have also been plentiful, especially since the disappearance of the minute floating diatomaceous Algce of very gelatinous consistence, which was so profuse about the sea during the summer months, and rendered tow-netting difficult from its tendency to choke the fine meshes of the net. It is in- tended to keep the station open during the winter should the funds permit, and several students are desirous of studying forms of life orly then procurable,\u2014Research,",

The attendance of members, British and foreign, was close upon 2,000. In the mathematical and physical section Mr R. T. Glazebrook, as president, speaking on electrical standards, said the resolutions adopted at Edinburgh would be made the basis of legisla- tion throughout the world. Professor Emerson Reynolds, in the chemical section, described the work of the past twelve months as substantial in character, and gave an outline of comparative chemistry. Mr J. J. H. Teal, discussing the Hutton theory in the geological section, ainrmed that the early stages of the planet's history still fonn; a legiti- mate subject for speculation. The President's address in the section on biology was, in the absence of Canon Tiistram, read by Sir W. FLOWER. Canon Tristram warned the observer of facts against the danger of becoming a mere materialist. In the geographical section Mr HENRY SEEBOHJI contributed an interesting address on exploration, on economic science, and statistics. Professor SHIELD IS ICHOLSON claimed signs of a reaction in favour of the old position of Adam Smith. The rapid increase of aerial navigation and the question of fuel supply were the subjects of Mr JEREMIAH HEAD'S address in the mechanical science section. Dr. ROBERT MUNRO, in the apthropological section, traversed the recent theory \"fif Mr Robert Wallace, and urged that against that, gentleman's hypothesis of natural selection was the pro- bability that many tribes of savages are in pcint bf civilisation more degenerate than their fore- fathers, and that there must be soma foundation of truth in the widely-spread tradition of the fall of man. In the ethnological section, a paper was read by Mrs Lily?Grove, F.R.G.S., ajFrench lady, who treated dancing from an o iiii:),ogical pointof view. Ladigs showed the greatest: interest in this paper, and frequently applauded the lady, who read and spoke with an admirable English accent. She treated dancing as a primitive instinct in humanity, which women, on account of their temperament, had cultivated more generally and with greater success than men. In the evening a soiree was held in the old castle.",

SIR,-In reply to \"Maggie Tueliver,\" allow me to say I have by me a copy of last year's Evi- dence Amendment Act, wherein it is permitted a witness to affirm without using any religious invocation; but this liberty doee not extend to jurymen -who, though they may affirm, still have to do so m a religious form. Geo. J. Holyoake, to whom your correspondent refers was himself refused as a juryman in 1857, and S. Mill in his essay on Liberty,'p 17, refers with indig- nation to his case and others as showing the popular intolerance of atheists, of whom he pro ceeite to speak in high terms. Professor Tyndall in his address at the Birmingham and Midland Institute last year, pointedly drew the attention of his audience to Mr G. J. Holyoake as one who had, perhaps, more than any other man freed himself from theological opinions. I he Professor passed a high encomium on him, and proceeded to speak of atheists as if he considered them more trustworthy than any other class. I am not aware that any of the gentlemen I .have named have called themselves atheists, and, therefore, I will not presume to say they are atheists, because I do not know how each would define the term as applicable to himself. But, as I understand the term, they are as much atheist as I, and I as they. There is no word, perhaps, that has so variable a meaning as the word \"God.\" Mr Herbert Spencer may confess to Theism when he speaks of a power of which humanity ia but a small and fugitive product\u2014a power which was in course of ever changing mani- festations before humanity was, and will continue through other manifestations when humanity has ceased to be,\" but we know that he seta forth that a belief in Providence is utterly denied by the sciences of biology and sociology, and says, There can be no complete acceptance of sociology as a science, so long as the belief in a social order not conforming to natural law sur- vivor.\" do Professor Tyndall, in the address I have referred to, by carrying invariable law com- pletely through every thought and action of man, of himself and his environment, leaves no room whatever for God, in an ordinary meaning of the word, As the .words Goo and Theism vary in their meanings. so their negative atheism.will vary. -1.am ke., THE ATHEIST GRAND JUROR.",

Thompson, Esq., of Stansty, there is, at the present time, a pear tree in full blossom, whilst there is upon the same tree an excellent crop of pears Occasionally we have read of similar freaks of nature, but we never remember to have seen any attempt to account for sneh curious phenomena. In the case of the orange tree the freak (if it be one) is made permanent. ELECTRO-BIOLOGY AND MESMERISM.\u2014Mr. Chad- wick, of Manchester, gave two very interesting lec- tures on the above sciences on last Thursday and Friday evenings, in the Music Hall. The phenomena produced were certainly of the most wonderful kind, and elicited the warmest admiration of the audience. Four individuals were operated upon at the same time, when each firmly believed his coat was on fire, and made every exertion to extinguish it! Water was then given to them, and the impression was that it was brandy and the usual symptoms of intoxication ensued. The individuals operated upon volunteered themselves out of the audience, so collusion or decep- tion of that nature was impossible. These lectures must be seen and heard to be at all appreciated, afford- ing as they do a varied and intellectual treat. We believe too that Mr. Chadwick on a subsequent even- ing intends giving a benefit, the proceeds of which is to be forwarded to the fund for assisting Lieutenant Perry. We hope as many as can will interest them- selves in this matter. Finp IV ABBOT STREET.\u2014On Thursday evening a fire originated in the house of Mr. Jenkins, Abbot street in a somewhat curious manner. The chimney by some chance took fire, and some of the masses of fire falling down a flue that was connected with a bed room, set fire to a bag that was stopping up the chimney. Presently the bag fell down into the room and set fire to different articles of wearing apparel which were con- sumed. The fire being perceived it was luckily soon extinguished without doing any material injury. The damage done amounts only to about \u00a3 0.",

W. P. Johns. It consisted of a handsome purse, con- taining twenty-one guineas, subscribed by the members of the Wesleyan church and congregation, and presented to Mr Johns as a mark of their appreciation of his zeal and ability in promoting the cause of Christianity among them, and as a token of gratitude for the good he has been the instrument of acomplishing. The meeting was presided over by Capt. J. Lewis. An appropriate address was read, to which Mr Johns very feelingly replied, and after a few observations by some of the friends the meet- ing was closed by singing and prayer. WESLEYAN TEA MEETING, BAZAAR. &c.\u2014This annual popular tea meeting will be held in the usual place by the Wesleyans of Milford and Hakin. A very large gathering is anticipated. Their excellent minister, the Rev. W. P. Johns (whose health is improving) is ex- pected to be present with other ministers. They also have it in contemplation to hold in the ensuing summer (under distinguished patronage) a bazaar, the proceeds to be applied to the relief of the Trust, and as it is con- fidently expected that the Milford Branch Railway will be opened in the course of that season, the committee have fixed on the same day for their bazaar. They respectfully solicit christian friends, and young ladies especially, kindly and generously to prepare some useful and ornamental work for the occasion. The circulars will soon announce the names of ladies who will be happy to receive the welcome contributions.",

I An incident occurred at Hawardon Castle on Monday evening-. The Premier, Mrs Gladstone, and the Misses Gladstone were going to dine with Mr aud Mrs Banks, Soughton Hall, Mold, Westminister. The Premier's coachmen was unable to drive, owing to indisposition, but an able substitute was found in Lord Aberdeen. His lordship put on the coachman's attire, and drove the dis- tinguished party to there distillation, returning with the carriage to the castle. The incident caused much amuse- ment; at Soughton Hall and the castle. The Pall Moll Gars-tin says Mr Goschen, who attended the meeting at the Mansion House ou Friday last as chairman of the London Society for the Extension of University Teaching, supplied a very necessary addition to Professor Huxley's description of East-end misery. The East-end of London is a very vague term, and contains not only the degraded and extremely poor, but also a large population with active intelligence as well as industry. We are conspicuous among other nations (Mr Goschen said) for our want of rational amusements for the poorbut we are honourably distinguished also from some other nations (as our readers may remember from Mr Burt's impres- sions of America) by the means of higher education provided for the poor through the University Extension Scheme. In seeking to combine the means of recreation which do not yet exist with a local habitation for the educational iiorlc already in progress, the promoters of last Friday's meeting have hit upon a thoroughly practical scheme. \"I know of no failure,\" said lr Goschen, \"where the attempt has been made in London to provide rational amusement; and as for education, we have (he added) 300 students in White- chapel alone following courses on biology, history, and political economy.\" Amid the confusion of charitable demands, benevolent people must often be tempted to ask Who can show us any good ? But here, at any rate, is a practical scheme which no one need hesitate to support.",

We seem to be living in an age of strange pheno- mena, both animate and inanimate; and the last few years, what with their shows of giants and dwarfs and monstrosities of divers kinds, will have done more to enrich the study of biology than many a century in the past. One of the last new human wonders is the young man at the Hotel Dieu, in Paris, who is now being attended by the cele- brities of the medical world for a new and appa- rently inexplicable malady. The man, who is now nineteen years and a half of age, had nothing at all the matter with him when at the age df about seventeen he seemed to have finished growing at the very respectable but not extraotd inary height of 6ft. 5in. On the 17th of May, 1881, he measured himself and found that he was a good inch taller than he had been a few weeks before. His curiosity being naturally aroused, he continued to take regular measurements every week, and found that his growing powers had actually made a fresh start. By the begin- ming-of the following September he had gained about three inches more. At the same time he expe- rienced peculiar aching paina in his bones, but the rate at which his stature increased seemed to develop itself more and more rapidly, so that in the beginning of the pre- sent year he had gained four inches more, and stood over seven feet without bis boots. Another quarter of a year found him full five inches taller and without any signs of Nature having exhausted her energies. Only in June last did the growth of his body cease, and since that time his legs have still been growing longer and thinner, till he has now reached the height, or rather the length-for he cap no longer stand upright-of ,7ft. lOin. His feet are described as each about 20in. long but he has no great use for them, as his feebleness iB too great for anyexereisewhatever.-Globe.",

To read what th *se gentlemen have to say about the aneipnr race which inhabits the Principality is really enough to take one's breath away. Whether it is out of compliment to the people who are so hospitably entertftining them that they select the longest words iheycan find in which to express themselves, or whether it is that the elemental principles cf Wi.JRb biology are too vast and far-reaching to be shad d forth in meaner language, we cannot pretend 0 fiecHe.

This p .int settled, nothing can be clearer than that by crossing tb' se two race- we obtain not only individuals of intermcfufv character, but occasionally more complex enrah;na- tioDS, as, for example, longitudinal exaggeration of the one race in association with lbe melanism and clolichocephalism d the other. When, how- ver WH have thus recognised the union of xanthous and melanic elements in Wales it does not follow rhar we have approached to anything like the exhausting lirait of the subject. Nevertheless it is at thss point that Mr Rudlei,in the most un pardon ably tantalis- ing manner, deserts us. The subject is kn de-p even for him. As an anthropolisfc, he gives the Welshman up. ilis antecedents may, he says, reach far down into some hidden primitive stoclz- older perhaps than the Neolithic ancestors of the Si.I,Mans\u2014but it is impossible to follow hina thither. In fact, says Mr Rudler in despair, I m \u00bby say of the Welshman, as a characterin Cymbeline says of FobLhumous, J 'I cannot delve him to the root.'

Biology\" was given on Tuesday evening, Feb. 8th, at the Hubberston school-room, by C. P. Stone, Esq, ia command of the troops at the fort, Hubberston, in aid of the national schools of the parish. The room was well filled, and the audience were greatly delighted at the practical illustrations that were iven by the lecturer of the power of mesmeric in- fluence. The amusing finale in which the subjects on the platform swam violently into an imaginary sea to save an imaginary ship in distress, brought the lecture to a close amid roars of iaughter and hearty applause of all present. The introductory part of the lecture was especially good, in which the lecturer, according to certain hypotheses which he laid down, explained the origin, power and laws of mesmeric influence. He advert-d also to the supposed power of mesmerism in rehg on and mentioned only to condemn a weak book on this subject lately published, ably putting forth, that electro b ology is not satanic nor superhuman in its origin, but as purely the result of a physical law. At the close of the lecture the Rev. J. B. Row- lands, in a humorous speech, proposed a vote of thanks to the lectuier adding, with reference to the position of science to religion, that whilst men spake of this and that science as fixed and unchangeable, he found that the dicta of scientific men were con stantly shifting and changing from age to age. lie knew of nothing fixed but God's own immutable, unchangeab'e, and eternal word which abideth firm for ever. Mr Bonniwell, the treasurer of the schooi fund, by whose assiduous efforts it is that the funds of the school are in their present prospering condi Hon, then seconded the vote of thanks, and in a neat speech announced that Mr Stone would give a second lecture in aid of a fund for the distressed poor of the parish, of which due notice would be aiven. The proceedings were then brought to a close.",

The tender of Messrs Turner and Sons, of Cardiff, for \u00a31,281 for the erection of new premises for the accommodation of the departments of physics, chemistry, and biology was accepted.\u2014A letter was read from Mr Butcher, secretary to the Brecon County Scholarship Fund, enclosing resolutions passed at a meeting ot the subscribers on the 25ch November with reference to the scholarships proposed to be established in con- nection with the college. They were to the effect that the council should fix the maximum age of the students that the scholarships should be open to males only; that the subscribers adhered to a previous resolution that the students must have been 10 years resident in the county that, as suggested by the council, there be two scholarships of \u00a320 each. The subscribers also affirmed that it was not desirable that the two scholarships should be competed for in the same year, and a, third scholarship would be started two years hence to prevent the double competition taking place at the same time. Under the ex- ceptional circumstances of the first examination, the Brecknock boys already studying in the college to be allowed to compete for the proposed scholarships should they fulfil the necessary re- quirements. The council resolved that the first examination should take place about the end of the Christmas vacation.\u2014The library and appara- tus committee reported that presents of books to the college library had been received from Earl Powis, Trofessor Parker (London), Messrs MacMillan and Co., the Rev. E. W. Evans, Miss Eleanor Roberts, and Messrs W. Gow (Welsh National Society) and T. J. Dyke, the gift of the last named being a valuable one, as it will form the nucleus of a medical library. A grant of JB55 was made to the chemical labora- tory, to include the cost of apparatus for experiments in electric lighting.\u2014On the motion of the Chairman, seconded by Principal Jones, ihe following resolution was passed\u2014 That this meeting learns with great satisfaction that the health of the President (Lord Aberdare), so seriously affected by the untoward accident which lately befel him, is such as to relieve all the anxiety for some time felt by the college and by the whole country.

                "full_text": "DRIFT BOTTLES. Marine monsters in the Irish Sea must have been puzzled of late to account for the remarkable number of bottles drifting about that particular bit of ocean. They are the drift bottles by which the Liverpool Marine Biology Committee is trying to pain further information m regard to those currents, whether tidal or due to prevalent) winds, which would affect small floating bodies. The bottles used are buoyant, strong, and well corked. They measure four inches in length and half an inch in diameter. Inside the bottle is placed a. small printed paper requesting the finder to fill in, in spaces left for the purpose, the date and locality, and to post it back. The papers are numbered and are folded in tho bottle in such a way that the distinguishing numbers can be read through the glass, so as to ensure that the bottles are set free in consecutive order. After the bottle has been corked up, the end is immersed a couple of times in melted paraffin, so as to close up the pores of the cork-none of the papers which have been returned, show signs of water having got into the bottles. The drift bottles are set afloat from steamers. The distribution has now been going on since the beginning of October, and a very fair proportion (about 30 per cent., or nearly one out of three) of the papers have already been returned duly filled in and signed. They have been picked up on various parts of the coast of tho Irish Sea\u2014Scotland, England, Wales, Isle of Man, and Ireland. Some of the bottles have gone quite a short dis- stance,having evidently been taken straight ashore by the rising tide. Others have been carried an unexpected length\u2014for example, one (No. 35), set free near the Crosby light vessel itt 12.30 p.m. on October 1st, was picked up at Saltcoats on November 7th, having travelled a distance of 180 miles\u2014probably far more-in 37 days or less another (H 20), set free near the Skerries, Angle- sey, on October 6th, was picked up at Ardrossan on November 7th, having gone at least 150 miles in 31 days. It would be premature as yet, until many more dozens or hundreds have been dis- tributed and returned, to draw any very definite conclusions.",

To the Editor of the \"Abergavenny Chronicle.\" SIR,-May I, on behalf of my committee, ask for the support of your readers in a national campaign which we are inaugurating against weeds ? We know that the adequate supply of food is of vital importance to the people of this country, and it will be readily admitted that the most practical way of increasing our home production is to see that we raise the highest possible yields off the area now sown or about to be sown with different crops. Among the different factors hostile to the food producer our plant enemies, the weeds, are the greatest and most regular source of loss. Experiments made abroad and confirmed by similar tests made in England showed that one weed alone, charlock, accounted for a reduction of 50 per cent. in the yield of oats, but indeed the statement that weeds cause a loss which throughout the whole of the country must reach enormous proportions requires no proof to anyone who has even cultivated only a garden patch. Modern biology teaches us that in theory all this vast loss of valuable food is preventable. In practice, therefore, we shall be successful in the eradication of weeds, and con- sequently the increase of our crops, in propor- tion to our ability to devise cheap and practical means of destroying weeds. Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Colonies seek to attain the object by means of Weed Acts. Here we believe that in times like these, when everyone is eager to render service, great service may be achieved by voluntary effort. We need first of all men or women who will undertake in their districts to act as local honor- ary secretaries ana organisers, ana to lorm Local Weed Campaign Committees and in the second place we shall need the help of every one of your readers who feels that he ought to do his share in destroying the useless to give elbow room to the useful, and so increase our store of food. The thirteen proscribed weeds are Thistle, bindweed, couch, buttercup, daisy, coltsfoot, nettle, dock, dandelion, charlock, chickweed, groundsel, poppy. I shall be pleased to send full particulars to any of your readers applying for it and enclosing a stamped, addressed envelope. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, T. J. RISEBOROUGH, Organising Sec. Smallholders' Goschen Buildings, Fnian. Henrietta St., Covent Garden, London, W.C. \u00bb",

The Press Association, telegraphing from Lon- don on Saturday, saysIn reference to the pro- posed meeting of the committee appointed by the Welsh party to consider the draft of the Welsh university charter, we were informed on inquiry at the Devonshire Club this morning that the meeting has been cancelled. DISCUSSION OF THE DRAFT CHARTER. A meeting of the council of the University College of Wales was recently held in Lonsdale- chatnbers, London, under the presidency of Mr. J. F. Roberts, Manchester, when there was an unusually large attendance.\u2014The draft charter was discussed at length, and the feeling was ex- pressed, and met with approval, that the same external examiners should conduct examinations at the three constituent colleges; and it was agreed\u2014 That this council, while approving generally of the draft-heads of the charter, would view with satisfaction the immediate insertion of provisions for the creation of a faculty of education. That proposition was agreed to unanimously. During the discussion on the scope of the univer- sity Dr. R. D. Roberts thought degrees should be obtainable by students outside the three con- stituent college. who, however, had followed a course of study prescribed by the university, while Mr. Lewis Morris was in favour of granting degrees to all comers who chose to present them- selves, and were able to satisfy the examiners.- Mr. William Williams, senior inspector of Welsh schools, was in favour of the scheme of the charter, thinking it more advisable that students should attempt to gain scholarships at one of the colleges or obtain private means to enable them to attend a course at one of the colleges than to protract their studies under difficul- ties outside. \u2014 No resolution was passed in the matter beyond the one already given.\u2014 The senate of the college reported that the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons had recognised the University College of Wales as a place of in- struction in chemistry, physics,practical chemistry, and biology, so that in future, students taking the medical course will be able to take a whole of the first part at the college, except in respect of anatomy and physiology.\u2014It was stated that the number of students at present in the college is 225, of whom no fewer than 92 are women.",

The death of Herbert Spencer removes one who may with great propriety be called the last of the old guard, the great band of Victorian philosophers, which inoluded such intellects as Mill and Buskin and Carlyle. Mr. Spencer was born at Derby April 27, 1820, and was, therefore, in his 83rd yea.r at the time of his decease. He had long lived in quiet retirement at his Brighton residence, where ho passed peacefully away this morn- ing, leaving behind him a memory that shall live as long as civilisation endures. At the age of eighteen young Spencer became a civil engineer, and continued for eight years to follow that profession. But in the early fortiM he abandoned engineering for econo- mics and sociology, in which he was destined after to become so great a master. His first essay in this direction was a series of letters in the \"Nonconiormist\" on The Proper Sphere of Government.\" Later on Mr. Spencer wae editorially connected with the II\" Economist,\" and also published articles in various reviews, and wrote his first impor- tant work, Social Statics, or the conditions essential to human happiness specified ,and the first of them developed.\" In 1855 appeared his famous Principles of Psychology,\" which four years before the appearance of the Origin of Species\" interpreted the pheno- mena of mind on the general principles of evolution. The list of Mr. Spencer s writings is long and important, dealing in a masterly manner with the most intricate problems of biology, sociology, psychology, ethics, educar tion, and general science. Many of his books have been translated into the leading foreign languages, including even Japanese and Chinese. In 1883 Mr. Spencer was elected a correspondent of the French Academy of Moral and Political Sciences for the section of Philosophy, in the room of Emerson, but he declined that, like all other academic honours and such like distinctions. Before he became a confirmed invalid Mr. Spencer's chief recreation wae angling. He was never married.",

The Liverpool meeting started yesterday with unwonted enthusiasm, chief amongst them being the presence of the King, com- bined with the brilliance of the weather and the great improvement of the card by the inclusion of the Liverpool Spring Cup. Despite his weight, Union Jack started a good favourite for the Cup, but he was never really in the hunt, and the blinkered Lanca- shire won cleverly from Wild Lad and Glena- moy. No complaint was lodged against Dillon, and in what he did he was merely actuated by zeal for his employer. There- fore, I can hardly imagine that the New- market authorities will take a serious view of his offence. That Moifaa may win the Grand National to-day for his Majesty is a general wish, and the way has certainly been made a little plainer when Kirkland recently met with a slight accident. Mr. Bibby and his friends have not altogether abandoned hope in last year's second, and they were quite satisfied with the way he carried him- self in a gallop yesterday morning. Aunt May has been befriended by first-class judges of a \"lepper,\" the Irish division, but I doubt her ability to jump this difficult country. The Hon. A. Hastings has wasted hard to do the weight on Dearslayer, but this horse is a most peculiar jumper, and when he tires he is almost certain to come to grief. For the mysterious detail I can say nothing favourable, and Ascetic's Silver is far too leggy. The Actuary, Longthorpe, Biology, Miss Clifden II., Saxilby, Kiora, Cottenshope, Band of Hope, Nereus, Buck- away II., and Hallgate may as well stay at home for all the chance they possess, and the issue may be safely narrowed down to I Moifaa, Sir C. Nugent's pair, Timothy Titus, and Royal Drake, and of these I must select I MOIFAA, I to win, and ROYAL DRAKE and NAPPER TANDY places. Other selections follow.- Bickenstaffe Stakes-VEDAS.

Nothing has yet been done in the matter of making preliminary arrangements locadly for the congress, but a meeting will be heid at the City-hall, Car- diff, on February 6 for the purpose of appointing a lcca.1 general committee and sub-committees to make preparations for the fitting reception of the institute. This meet- ing has been convened by the Lord Mayor (Councillor Illrtyd Thomas), and will be attended by the following representatives ol the institute:\u2014Mr. II. D. Searles Wood, F.R.I.B.A., chairman of council; Colonel J, Lane Notter, R.A.M.C., M.A., M.D., vioe-chaip ma-n of council; and Mr. W. Whitaker, B.A. F.R.S., F.G .,S., Aasot.M.Inat.C.E., chairman 01 the congress committee. The first business of the meeting will be to elect a representative general committeet which will be split up into such &mb-com. nuttees as exhibition committee, excuredoou committee, reception and hospitality cam mittee, finance committee, and literary and press committee. The pt?oeedmgs will be opened on July U with an inaugural address by the Earl .1 Plymouth, who is this year's president. Then the congress will be divided into sectional meetings, which will deal with sanitary science and preventive medicine, engi- neering and architecture, physics, chemistry, and biology. Following these meetings will be various conferences of municipal repre. sentatives, medical officers of health, engi- neers and surveyors, and veterinary inspec- tors, and also a conference on school hygiene. These sectional meetings will be held every morning, and the afternoons will be taken, up with excursions to different places of interest from a public health point of view. One promiineTit feature of the congress will be the exhibition of sanitary appliances, which will be open for a-bont three weeks.. The building in which that exhibition will be held has yet to be decided upon, but it is not improbable that the committee will. be able to secure the temporary builddn g: which is to be erected by the Grocers' Aaso- ciation in time for that body's annual meet- ings. The status of the Royal Sanitary Institute (which comprises about 2,000 members) may: be ganged by the fact that when its annual congress was held in Berlin, two years ago, the delegates were personally received by the German Emperor.

                "full_text": "MOTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE NORTH WALES UNIVER- I SLTY COLLEGE. On Saturday last, the 3rd inst., another t \"ery interesting ceremony took place in Connection with the North Wales Univer- sity College at Bangor, viz., the opening of a biological laboratory in addition to the Chemical and physical laboratories already listing. These laboratories in their ^tensiveness and completeness form a characteristic feature of the North Wales I institution they are, we believe, superior to in the Principality and to many of those found in connection with the English Universities. From the fact that such \"excellent arrangements have been made in fitting up these practical science workshops, .,we may conclude that the college authori- ses attach great importance to scientific Fining, and to making that training as efficient as possible. Certain it is that no Institution bearing the name of a University College could possibly be considered com- Plete in its arrangements that did not make 4niple provision for scientific training, and 110 scientific training can possibly be tfficient without ample provision for labora- tory work. The College at Bangor ought to attract a large number of students devoted to science, for the opportunities Afforded are truly excellent in every respect credit to the Principality. The study 'Of science is growing more and more Popular every day in this country, and will Continue to grow as the advantages become Zlore generally recognized. We have often pondered that the Grammar Schools of Wales pay so little attention to the study science. Before the midsummer vaca- tions the newspapers were crowded with teports of examinations, but we do not retn\u00e8mber to have seen a single instance of any. branch of natural science having been taken up. Surely this is a mistake which 0llght to be rectified, and will be rectified ^heti the Welsh Intermediate Education becomes an Act and put into practical Operation, if not before. With many boys the study of natural science ^Ust be far more useful and interesting than classical studies. Take the sOns of farmers, for instance, who are to be- totne farmers themselves and who are only to remain at school for a very limited Period. Would it not be of infinitely more ^alue to them to have an elementary know- ledge of chemistry, physiology, and botany ZIY than a smattering of Latin and Greek ? Moreover, boys intended for the medical Profession, if they had their minds well jined with the elementary facts of science In their school days, would be far more likely to pursue their scientific studies suc- cessfully in riper years. The presence of Professor Michael Foster, Cambridge, at the inauguration ceremony lent considerable interest and eclat to the Proceedings. His able and interesting Address was a plea for the study of biolo- Ejcal science, and for the right study of it. spoke of the laboratory as a protest ?gainst the text book,\" that is, he meant to ttnply, we presume, that biology is pre- eminently a practical science, and one which can not be properly grasped without Personal observation of the processes in- volved. He pointed out how closely allied ^ere biology and agriculture. The farmer had to do with the feeding of cattle, to grow that fodder which would produce the greatest amount of flesh and fat, to gather from the soil as much living material as it ^as possible could be got,\" and thus he told ^is audience, \"the whole matter of the growth of corn became largely a biological Problem.\" The learned professor sees in the more enlarged study of biological Science an antidote for the agricultural de- pression so loudly complained of; for by \u00f9dequate manipulation of the soil was it tlot .possible to advance the art of farming, and so strike the balance against the im- Port of foreign grain, and enable the British farmer to once more lift up his head.\" We commend these observations to (the attention of Lord Iddesleigh and his Commission. For our own part we fear that if We are to wait for the revival of agricul- ture until all farmers become skilled bio- logists we shall hear this agricultural moan- Ing going on for some considerable time to come. The distinguished Professor tnade a sly, hit, too at the Agrarian reformers up and down the country, for he observed that the agri- cultural distress about which so much was .beard now-a-days was perhaps attributable Hot so much to the division of land as to the want of the multiplication of know- ledge.\" It seems to us that both are Squaliy necessary, and that the latter, to a great extent, depends upon the former. The greater the number of persons who have a direct interest in the soil, the greater will be the number of those who Will be interested in acquiring the special knowledge necessary for its cultivation. The possession of land will act as a stimulus to the full development of its resources. If the increased pecuniary results arising from the multiplication of knowledge find their Way into the pockets of people other than \"those who have produced them, it must be granted without reserve that this will not tend to the multiplication of knowledge, but will prove-and doubtless does prove- to be a very effective counteracting force. The land problem in England at the pre- sent time will obviously not be solved simply by recommending the study of biological science. The whole proceedings were deeply in- teresting to Welshmen as a further develop- ment of the higher education of the people. We trust the youths of the Principality will learn to appreciate these efforts, and avail themselves of the great privileges now brought to their very doors.",

                "full_text": "DISLOYALTY OF MR. GRAYSON. 4 INSULTING REFERENCE TO THE KING. \u2022Speaking at a densely crowded meeting under the auspices of the Social Democratic Federation at Lincoln on Friday evening, Mr. Victor Grayson said in the last week or so the country had been seething. A tumult had been going on because of a certain breach of law and order. His reply was that the :first breach of law and order was committed when the upper and middle classes filched from the workers the moans to live. All other questions must be put on the shelf inexorably till that of uibetmployment was settled. The Socialist was not an extraor- dinary person. He was merely an obser- vant animal, who saw an object in the I streets and did not content himself with Eoai ng the object, but saw through it and philosophised on it. Some time ago Parlia- I ment were asked to consider the question of feedir g the school-children. They said, \"We have no time. We have an overlapping pro- gramme. We have legislative indigestion, and we cannot spare a half-day to devote to the feeding of children.\" (\"Shame.\") It was not a week after that that the House of Commons was wasting a couple of hours congratulating the Prince of Wales on the birth of a child. (\"Shame.\") STARVING DOG PARALLEL. Mr. Grayson continued: The Premier, John I Burns, and Winston Churchill all said there will be no legislation for unemployment this year, Oh, get a poor starving dog and starve him until you ha.ve starved him almo6t to a skeleton, and when the dog makes a bound for you, determined to have food, you say to that dog: \"There will be no food this year; we have an overcrowded programme.\" The dog will remind you of its undercrowded I stomach. Then when the dog bites, you shout, \"Order, order!\" I would break the most sacred la.w on God's earth if that law stood between a human being and a meal. I believe that to die of sta.rva.tion in the land of plenty would disgrace the most primitive people who ever lived. We do not want to feed the loafer when the loafer has a chance to work and on medical inspection is found fit and only mentally indisposed. I would commit him to the lethal chamber with as little compunction as I would kil a rat. I do not love a loafer, but I tell you that when they counted the dead bodies afterwards there would be more aristocrats amongst them than people of the lower classes. (Cheers, groans, and prolonged interruptions.) They (the Socialists), continued Mr. Grayson, told the Government they believed they knew how this problem of unemployment could be solved. They might not be right. He merely stated they had worried out a way of solving the problem. They thought it was right. They were willing to give their lives for it, and they asked for a trial to find out how to solve unemployment. They would no longer conduct themselves decor- ously to society of society refused them the last chance of feeding the hungry popula- tion. If one man starved they all felt branded with the brand of murder. \"A PARASITE.\" Questions were invited at the close, and promptly came the query, What did you call the King the other day?\" Mr. Grayson answered: I think the term I used was a term well known in biology-a, parasite. (Prolonged hooting.) A parasite is am organism that draws its sustenance from another organism. I have not the slightest objection to the King. I might be in favour of some decorative sym- bol under Socialism of a similar kind. All eapitalis-to are parasites. The King draws rent, interest, and profits out of investments in land and companies. Rents and profits are exclusively produced by labour, and the person who takes them to live on while others create them is known in biology as a parasite, and I have applied it to sociology.\" THE INSUI/TS OF ANANIAS.\" Mr. \"Jack\" Williams, speaking on Friday at a demonstration of the unemployed on Tower Hill, said time after time on the floor of the House of Commons the working class had been insulted, and even while Labour members sat and listened, raising no protest whatever; John Burns had called them a drunken lot. After telling them that they spent seven bob a week on beer, he went further, and said that the unemployed of England were more drunken than the unemployed of America. They were asked to put up with the insults of Ananias, and not use any strong language.",

                "full_text": "Ethical and k-sthetic Aspect of Art. MR D. FFRANGCON DAVIES'S LECTURE. There was a large and appreciative audience at the Cory Hall. CardiLT, on Monday evening, when Mr D. Ffrangcoa Davies lectured, under the auspices of the Cardiff Y.M.C.A., on The Ethical and JEsthetic Aspect of Art.\" Mr F. S Higman presided, and briefly introduced the lecturer, who was very heartily received. Mr D. Ftrangcon Davies urged at the outset that art, was moral as well pleasing. Modern life was complex, and it! was difficult to find the harmony in life as the initiated saw it. The many ways in which life could be looked at resolved themselves into two\u2014the material and ths spiritual. All agreed that the physical-the material-was Dot 1asting. In choosing one's view of lifo therefore, one naturally, chose that which began, continued. and ended in goad. The one that presented permanence, the true view of life, was the one which showed that there was a good purpose behind it. Whatever the material sense might be, the-view which prcsenti-d this ideal was the spiritual, and not the material. And this was the key of the mastery of life. Speaking of the vocal art, the lecturer said that generally the world had been putting the cart. before the horse for about 300 years. Men had preferred the material to the spiritual. The vocalist had made the voice the horse and mind the cart instead of mind the horse and voice the cart. The Commanding Ideas had been in vocal art beauty, bigness, blatant loudness. His objection to these as the main thinpa was that they were not causes but effects. if one wanted to serve art they must deal in causes and not effects. Beauty could be recognised, but it could not be defined it was indefinable. Real noble, sonorous tone was that which carried with it words and atmosphere, which represented beauty to the musician. He was not indifferent to vocal beauty, but he urged they must have more truth in the tone, more reason, more mind. Simple loudness only appealed to a man's shell. If a man followed art in order to make money at it, he would never make an artist. He might make money. The only other thing he would make would be a bad. ugly noise. If evolution meant anything it meant that the important thing was not what one liked, but what one had taught himself to like. m MR FFRAXGCON DAVIES. J Simip-w: t?n v.o.y <jT things was ivas the protest which rational art aiwajs had entered, always did enter, and always would enter against unmusical megalomania, what he might call time servirg art. Many modern performances resolved themselves into occa- sions for the exercisc of a specious art. a kind of vocal dram drinking, supposed to be very pleasing. He who adopted a non-moral. non- vital. non-religious view of art was liable to develop into a. cultish mechanic, an intellec- tual Lucifer, or he might finally appear AS the occupant of a self-built cage in what he might call a, pseudo-artistic zoological garden. (Laughter and cheers.) Negation bad oeen busy, and had denied the essential goodness of creation. Man must therefore restate his creed, and say, I believe i'uat God is that He is gcod that He :.<ladc me. I believe that I am I belicT?^ that f am good I be- lieve in myself and I go fortb to justify ruy faith. I behave in God, and I believe in man I beliey0 that they are both good with a cora- ?iion goodness.\" Instead of human theology let them have divine biology. And the chief element in tbi-I divine biology was an imagina- tivti reason. The artist was primarily a man of reason, who had exercised his reasou in such a manner that he inherited freedom. There were three words which neither priestly nor -tnti anti-priestly bigotry had been able to remove from the human conscience\u2014 God-Freedom -Immortality. These three had been shown by such men as Kandt, MartirLcau. and that distinguished Welshman, Professor Henry Jones, to arise out of man's nature and reason. These three great words conveyed to the artist ideas of infinite Jilc and beauty, nnd liberty to seek and mani- fest themselves. They also implied continuity and energy of purpose for the task. He had often startled people by saying that to him (the lecturer) Jesus the Christ, was the greatest artist that ever lived. His whole life was an object lesson in art. His outlook was spiritual that was art Jtwas also life and every life was a crystallised principle. If they tried tro separzlte art and life they took the life out of their art. Faith was a necessity; it must make its own experiments in the laboratory of life. It grew out of reasou and out of self-mastery and self- knowledge. The real artist always suggested more than he saw. Art was scientific, rational, philosophical, ethical, and divine. The career of the artist was therefore a noble one. He served God and man. He (the lecturer) was a thorough believer in the powers of musical artists in this country. Tbl-Y had minds and they had voices. Life would be easier, pleasanter, better for the work they did. and they would show through th? lofty character of their work that music and song were manifestations uf spiritual activity, in which activity life re- vealed itself as iove and truth in that fine poetry and music which man had brought forth through much suffering.

We arc heartily glad to be able to give this account of the corps. ELECTRO-BIOLOGY & MESMERISM,\u2014On Monday even- ing week M. Zamoiski gave his interesling entertainment on Electro-Biology arid Mesmerism, at the Gate House Assembly Room. The room was well filled, and M. Zamoiski repeated his performance on Friday and Mon day. THE ELIGOG STACKS.\u2014These remarkable rocks, in the neighbourhood of St Gowans, known 'as the Eligog Stacks, are now well worthy of a visit from visitors to our town, The birds, which form the principal objects of attraction, are now congregated in immense numbers on the Stack rocks. TRUE IVORITES -On Tuesday week, the Tenby Lodge of True Ivorites held their annual meeting, and attended divine service at the parish church, and paraded through through the principal streets of the town, accompanied by the Tenby Volunteer brass band. They numbered about eighty members. SAUNDERSFOOT.\u2014'The Benefit Club of this village met according to annual custom, on Saturday, the 12th inst., at the Picton Castle Inn, from whence they marched in procession, headed by a brass band. On their return they sat down to an excellent and substantial dinner, where, after the usual toasts, &c, they concluded the evening with dancing. ACCIDENT.-On Monday, the ]4th inst., as a collier boy, aged about fourteen years, of the name of Absolom, was working at the Grove Pit, a large stone in the upper part of the working became loosened and fell on him, breaking one of his legs and severely lacerating the muscles. We hear that though the limb is in a very bad state there is a chance of its being saved. CONCERT.\u2014We hear it is the intention of the St. Florence choir to give a concert before long. As the formation and advancement of the choir of St. Florence has occupied the earnest attention of the worthy rector, the Rev. Mr Birkett, for the last thirty-five years, we may be sure of an afternoon's agreeable amusement. One night last week, Capt. Bailey, accompanied by some friends, was driving a spirited horse down the Norton, when the animal suddenly made off at a. tremen- dous speed. One gentleman and the servant jumped out, and the vehicle pursued its course with increased velocity till it neared the rectory gate, when the horse swerved down with its fore legs at the bottom and the hind legs at the top of the steps, unable to extricate itself. Capt. Bailey was thrown out and was picked up insensible. We are happy to say that, beyond being stunned, he suffered no injury. TOWN COUNCIL. A Special Meeting of the Town Council was held on the 18th inst. Among other matters a memorial from the inhabitants was read, complaining that the firing of the guns was a nuisance in their present position. It was resolved that the memorial of the inhabitants should be taken into consideration at the next quarterly meeting, and that the officer in command of the battery be requested to discontinue firing the great guns during the season, otherwise the Council would be compelled to apply to the Secretary of State to remove the battery. During the discussion that preceded the resolution the Mayor remarked, that besides its nearneos to the houses, one great objection was thai the balls passed over two roadways, and that although he had never witnessed its yet it has been known that balls have (through some flaw in the iron) broken in pieces; and should such a I thing happen, one of the pieces might unfortunately hit some passer by, and serious perhaps fatal injuries be the result. It was also resolved that notice be given to Mr JameS Owen, of Quay Hill, to repair the garden wall on the side of the roadway leading from Bridge-street to the Pier. With respect to the Burial Ground for Dissenters, the mortgagee agrees the release to ground for the sum of \u00a3 200. The Council were of opinion that if the Dissenters would lend the Corporation the \u00a3200, at 4 percent, and agree to pay the expenses of conveyance, &c, they could have it for burial purposes.",

                "full_text": "WREXHAM BFLi.-s.-IVe are informed that it is inten- ded to make a collection at Christmas annually, for the encouragemcut of the practice of bell ringing. A few amateurs have already commenced ringing; their practice Ii., been limited to once a week, but we hope that as they get more efficient and new hands introduced, we shall have the pleasure of hearing them oftcner, and that under the instruction of our worthy sexton, they will become quite learned in the mysteries of Campanology\u2014it affords much agreeable and innocent amusement to young men of an evening, and tends to enliven the town. No doubt a good collection will be made at Christmas to stimulate them in their efforts. V/KEXIIAIR IIONT.Y FAIR\u2014This fair, held on Tuesday last, was exceedingly well attended, t here being a plenti- ful show of cattle and Leasts of all kinds. A;non-t the fat beasts we noticed 40 head of fine animals from Ire- land, to Mr. Foigglv, which were ail sold, three of them being purchased by Mr. David Samuels. Of pigs there was a large muster of which the greater part were evedually disposed at something lower rates. Store sheep likewise were on the decline, which indeed was the case with all caltle generally in cumqncncc of the great scarcity of grass, arising from the late protracted drought. Of horses there w:is a fair show, and amongst them were some valuable iulmrls. Mr. right, of Gresford, show- ed two splendid cart colts for which we heard he refused seventy five guineas. This being prc-eniineutly the Iloney fair, a very large quantity of that delicious ar. ticle was offered for sale, most of it being of very superior quality. At first, purchases were but slowly made, but at last it was all cleared off at about 3s. per quart aver- age price. In the evening crowds of people came into the town from the adjoining populous districts, which gave the town a bustling and animated appearane. Altogether there has not been a better or fuller fair for some time past than the one held on Tuesday last. TOWN HALL CLOCK.\u2014We wish to draw the attention of the Inspectors of Lighting to the fact that the so called illuminated clock in the Town Hall, is still left to remain in utter darkness. During the long winter nights that arc now rapidly approaching, this clock if lighted, will be of great utility to the town's people, as well as an orna- ment to the town. We do not wish to make unseemly quotations, but we respectfully call upon the Inspectors to lighten our darkness in this particular. MESMERIC AND ELECTIIO-BIOLOGIAL E.VTEKTAIN- 3LENTS.\u2014Mr. C'hadwick, professor of these branches of science, has given three entertainments in the Music Ilall during the past v. eek, and we are to say with very considerable success. Elcctro-Biology is a science unknown to the majority of people, aud is even now sometimes most inaccurately confound'd with Animal Magnetism. It appears from what we ourselves witnes- sed that the science (if scieace it be) is but in an imper- fect stage, for Mr. Chadwick, although he succeeded in many instances, he did not invariably do so some indi- vi duals being entirely unsusceptible of this mysterious in- fluence, whilst others were only partially so. On Tues- day night we found ourselves wending towards the Music Hall, and a few minutes after eight o'clock Mr. Chad- wick mounted the platfor..i, and commenced his intro- ductory lecture. He proceeded to explain the difference between Mesmerism and Electro-Biology, and likewise gave a brief sketch of their history. lie then attempted to meet the ordinary objections which are urged against them, and in doing so, unquestionably displayed much candour as well as force of argument. After this the en- tertainment for the evening commenced by his summon- ing to him on the platform any person desirous of being operated upon. Immediately more than a dozen boys rushed up the Hall, and eventually two gentlemen ju:.lCd them. He arranged them in rows, and proceeded at once to experiment upon them. Out of the number, some S or 9 remained, who were deemed good patients, the two gentlemen not being of the number. A sympathetic iu- ilnence being now supposed to exist between the operator and his subjects, he proceeded to illustrate it. lie told the boys to opea their mouths, which they in vaiii at- tempted to shut, until he gave them permission to do so. The boys were then ordered to put their hands iulo their pockets, and the almost frantic but useless endeavours of some of them to take them out ngain created roars of laughter amongst the company. The boys professed to be entirely free from all pain whatever, but more especially toothache-whcn with a move of the hand he caused them to writhe under an instantaneous attack of tLat dreaded tormentor! He set them in an imaginary flame of fire, and their wild, genuine, and energetic efforts to extinguish it, caused such boisterous bursts of merriment that must have greatly offended the decorous genius of the Music Hall. A youth from Charles-street, was or- dered to throw away a chair out of his hands, but his al- most frenzied efforts were quite in vain, as the chair ap- peared a portion of himself, and seemed no more likely to loose him than his arms did. The apparcnt truth at least of these performances were really astonishing, and the amazement of the company was genuine and com- plete. After this, Mrs. Chadwick was operated upon, and whilst in the mesmeric state, laughed, sang, or rocked her baby, just to suit the wishes of the operator. With the utility or even truthfulness of these cntcriainm<nits, we at present arc not in a position to speak positively, but as an agreeable way of obtaining an hour's relaxation they arc to be classed very highly.",

I The Press Association learns that Lord Iveagh is proposing a comprehensive scheme which will probably cost him a quarter of a million sterling for the improvement of the insanitary area in the heart of the city of Dublin. His proposal, which will take the form of a Bill in the coming Session of Parliament, will deal with that part of the Irish Metropolis which is known as the Bnll Alley area, forming the centre portion of the district from St. Patrick's Cathedral to Christ- church Cathedral. Eis Lordship contemplates acquiring the area between Bull Alley and Bride's Alley, and utilising the site partly by giving certain portions to the Dublin Corporation for straightening, widening, and improving adjacent streets, but chieiiy for the erection of two classes of buildings, viz., workmen's dwellings, a. lodging house for single men, and shops, aJ'!o certain re- I creative buildings such as large concert halls, '\u00a1 reading and lecture rooms, swimming bath, and gymnasium. The promoter will execute the whole I scheme at his owe cost. Eventually the control and management of the property will be vested in the Guinness trustees, who will be prevented I from letting or using the recreative buildings for political purposes of a party character or for sectarian meetings. The Press Association his been requested to publish the followiug communication respecting an offer of a quarter of a million made by Lord Iveagh to the Council of the .Tenner Institute, and its acceptance on behalf of that body by Lord I Lister and Sir Henry lioscoe We permis- sioa to announce a splendid offer in aid of scientific research which has been placed in our ) hands. British and Irishmen of science have long deplored the fact that the opportunities in this country for research directed to the prevention of disease are not equal to those possessed by I foreign nations. Lord Iveagh wishes to help in removing this reproach to onr country, and on \u00a1 the conditions named below has offered the sum I, of SZOOW for the purposes of the highest research in bacteriology and other forms of biology as bearing upon the cause, nature, pre- vention, and treatment of disease. He has pro- posed to the Council of the Jenner Institute (lately the British Institute) of Preventive I Medicine, a body which includes leading men in I medicine and allied sciences in the British Isles. that the donation shall be handed over to the institute on condition that in future the control I and management of the aftairs of the institute shall be placed in the hands of a new board of seven trustees, t:1ree of the seven to be chosen by I the Council of the institute, three by the donor, I and one by the Council of the Royal Society. The offer has been cordially accepted at a meet- ing of the Council. The donor further proposes that part of the new fund shall be appropriated to the enlargement of the buildings of the insti- tute at Chelsea, part to increasing the at present sadly inadequate salaries of the director and other members of the scientific staff, part to the expenses of administration and maintenance, and the remain,\"er chiefly to foimo'ir-g valuable fellowships and studentships, tenable for limited periods of research, either in tie laboratories of \u00a1 the institution or in centres otithe outbreaks of disease whether at home or abroad. The condi- tions on which these fellowships and studentships may be held are not yet determined upon, but it is hoped to open them to all classes of her Majesty's I subjects. Lord Iveagh, in our opinion, deserves the gratitude of the nation for thus munificently \u00a1 providing for the cultivation in the British dominion of biology and allied sciences for the good of mankind in an institution which hence- forth will compare favourably with any similar establishments in other parts of the world. U We have the honour to b, sir, your obedient servants, Lister, chairman of Council; Henry E. Roscoe, hon. treasurer.\" 1-",

                "full_text": "SCIENCE NOTES. 1 [WRITTEN SPECIALLY FOR TUTS PAPER]. I CHARLES DARWIN, when writing those chapters in the Origin of Species,\" which deal with the geological record of past life on this earth was inspired with that spirit of truth and humility which so characterises modem science. In them he pointed out how very difficult it was to reconcile some facts with the theory which he propounded and indeed, with perfect cat dour, he admitted that so far as the account given by the rocks went, the evi-derce in favour of his hypothesis was but small. On those chapters, alluded to, a magnificent temple of un- mistakable evidence rears its head. Research, since Darwin's time, has resulted in the acca- mulating of a rich store of facts which, in ttoa main, support the theory which he gave to The world. This evidence is very much scattered in its literary sense, as it ts geographically, and the general reader has but small chance of reviewing it; such being the case, it is pleasing to find that Professor Angelo Heilprin has published a book entitled the \"Geological evidences of Evolution.\" It is a charming book. Devoid of scientific ter- minology, it will be within easy reach of those who have taken a slight interest in natural history and geology; and those who kept the proverbial weather eye open in their young days when taking their country rambles. The little work under notice takes up the question of organic evolution where Darwin left it, and fills in the gap between that time and this. Professor Heilprin is, of course, a confirmed evolutionist, but what man of any scientific value is not ? By the way, the Duke af Argyll will probably have something to say about Professor Heilprin's book. Mr. J. R. Ainsworth Davies, B.A., of the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, has published a work on Biology (London: Griffin and Co., 1888). In these days of cram versus knowledge and intellectual health, the book will be appre- ciated, but let not the anxious seeker after ''degree\" run away with the idea that this book really teaches anything in particular- much lessteactes biolcgy. Oh that this abomin- able craze for the brain -spoiling system of ex- amination could be modified so that the student shculd really [Ie a student and not as he now is, a receptacle for a heterogeneous nebulosity of attenuated no'ions which have no real existence in the world of fact. The Oxford1-\" poll\" RA. man is a living witness to the failure of the exambusiness on the one hand, and the man who has studied a hundred and one \"ologies\" is an example on the other. The book referred to will be an admirable library for individuals of the above class, but for the honest working student it falls to the ground. Professor Lloyd Morgan's little book, which is also very \"crammy,\" is certainly a better friend to the biological student than most works of the kind, but to compare such books with those that teach biology by natural methods would be invidious. \u2022 Two popular monthlies in their notes on science, &c., are now informing the British public that it is possible to procure a light by means of a small battery and incandescent lamp which can be used for night light purposes, &c. This is certainly very subeditory \u00bb # A somewhat novel method of making a testimonial is that which is being carried out in the case of Profess r Donders, of Utrecht, 011 his retirement from the professorial chair. A large sum of money has been subscribed, which will be handed to Professor Donders on the 28th inst.. in a public manner. Speeches will be made, and then the Professor will name the purpose to which he wishes the sum applied. If there is one thing men of science place the right value on it is vvmri. It has long been known that there is some common source of energy, of which light hear, &c., are but modifications. The grand doctrine of conservation is, of course, a generalisation of the broad truth. Whatever the real connec- tion he between one force and another it is certain that future research will discover means of transmuting classes of phenomena\u2014indeed, this is fairly well accomplished, and is the every day experience of the scientist. The ground which is most difficult to break is that which covers the interdependence of electricity and light, and any research which illumines the gioom that necessarily surrounds hypothesis is consequently of great interest. Professors Ruckerand Boys showed some very beautiful experiments at the conversazione of the Royal Society illustrative of the effect of electrical stress on light. A ray of light which had been extinguished by means of crossed Nichol prisms (a. rhomb of Iceland spar, bisected in a special manner, and fixed by means of Canada Baham), was restored when the medium in which the prism, &c., was placed was subjected to electrical stress. At the same conversazione, Professor Boys showed seme extremely interesting experiments with suap bubbles. The soap bubble, although associated in our minds with the homely wash- tub, and the orthodox cold dinner on the auspicious occasion of cleansing the family raiment, has a high reputation iu the scientific mind. From Newton down, one and all have made some valuable discoveries, or observed some interesting points in this infantile emana- tion.",

Patrons-The Principal and Fellows of Jesus College, Oxford. CLERIcAL.-The Rev. D. W. Thomas, M.A., has been appointed Rural Dean of Arllechwedd, in place of the Rev. P. C. Ellis.-We understand that no appointment has yet been made to the vacant Chaplaincy; that the living of Llardestyn is to be separated from Penllech, and a township now attached to it.-We learn with extreme pleasure that the Venerable Archdeacon Evans will remain at Llanllechid, where his great zeal and piety are warmly appreciated by the parishioners. We have much pleasure in stating that Mr T. W. Wynne Jones, second son of the Archdeacon of Bangor' was elected on the 7th inst. to a junior studentship at Christ Church College, Oxford, value JS85 per annum, and tenable for five years. There were sixteen candi- dates. Mr Wynne Jones is in his Ildth year, and has been educated at Eton, to which school he was elected as King's scholar at the age of ten, by competitive ex- amination, when he was the fourth successful candidate out of forty-five. MEDICAL INSPECTOR OF ARMY RECRUITS.\u2014We havo much pleasure in stating, for the information of the pub- lic, that his Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief has just appointed Dr Richards, of this city, the medical inspector for all recruits for her Majesty's army for Bangor and its neighbourhood. BANGOR CRICKET CLUB.\u2014We are happy to have to state that the promoters of cricket in Bangor have suc- ceed d in definitely obtaining the Friars Field as a cricket ground, which, taken altogether, is the best site which could be had in or around the city. The ground will come into the possession of the club on the first of May next, after which the cricket season of 1868 in Bangor, will commence in good earnest. We trust the friends of this noble and manly game will bestow upon the club their liberal patronage, and that those who from any cause are prevented from joining it in the capacity of active members will support it financially, and occasionally by their presence. We trust, too, the young gentlemen of this city will avail themselves of this opportunity of making themselves good cricketers. PROFESSOR WILLIAMS.\u2014ELECTRO-BIOLOGY.\u2014Nearly every evening this week, Professor Williams has been giving his amusing, clever, and popular entertainments in electro-biology, in the Penrhyn Hall, Bangor. Some of the experiments are really most surprising, and would scarcely be credited by anyone who had never witnessed them in fact, the Professor is a perfect master of his art, and surpasses all, in our opinion, who have yet visited Bangor. We understand it is his inten- tion to visit other Welsh towns, and we would strongly recommend our friends to pay him a visit when they have as opportunity, and we feel certain they will be higbly pleased and delighted. The silver watch was obtained by Master Davies, of Garth, and the beautiful silver electro-plated coffee service by Mr Kernel, a visitor, at the George Hotel; and last night, an electro- plated cake basket by Mr Hunter Hughes, of the Canonry, with a host of minor gifts, including a toast- rack, butter-cooler, albums, &c. CARNARVON TRAINING COLLEGE.\u2014A special meeting of this college was held in Bangor, on Tuesday last, in reference to the case of the Principal, the Rev. W. Boucher. There was a numerous and influential atten- dance present, amongst others being the Lord Bishop of St. Asaph, Right Hon. the Lord Penrhyn, Sir Stephen Glynue, W. Bulkeley Hughes, Esq, M.P.; the Dean of Bangor, &c. The meeting was appointed to take place in the Chapter Room in the Cathedral, but owing to the indisposition of the Bishop of Bangor, the meeting, after being formally opened by the Bishop of St. Asaph, was adjourned to the Palace, so as to have the assist- ance of the Bishop of Bangor. It being a committee meeting only, reporters to the press were excluded but we learn that, after a somewhat animated discussion, it was resolved that Mr Boucher be continued in the office until the 3rd of April next, when another meeting will be called for the purpose of re-appointing a principal, and in the meantime advertisements are to be inserted in the papers. POLICE COURT, Monday, March 16th, before Major Vincent Williams. A Deserter.-A soldier, named John Hill, was brought up in custody charged with being a deserter from the 1st Royal Dragoon Guards. After hearing the evidence of the police, the prisoner was sent to Carnarvon gaol to await orders from his regiment. L(treeny.-Margaret King was in custody on a charge of stealing a variety of articles, there being no less than five charges of larcency preferred against her. She was remanded until the next Petty Sessions to be held on Tuesday next. Chai-ge of Begg,ing.-A tramping fellow who said his name was Benjamin McDuffwas in custody, charged by P.S. Griffith Jones with begging the day previously at Bethesda. The evidence not being very conclusive, the man was discharged, with a caution. William Morris, another of the vagrant tribe, was charged by P.C. John Jones with having committed a similar offence. This charge being proved, he was sent to gaol for seven days.",

It was calculated that the cost of the building, altera- tions, fittings, and furniture would amount to \u00a3 5,000. Deducting this sum and EI,500 for preliminary ex- penses out of the promises actually paid. the balance of capital to yield income when invested would be ;Cll,Wo. The current payments to which the council was committed were \u00a3 4,850, showing a deficit of f500 to E600 a year until further subscriptions are paid up.

The Principal read a report of the Senate on the applications. Notice was given of a motion for the next meeting ot the council to rescind a professor at \u00a3400. and also a motion to the effect that the lecturers should be appointed at \u00a3 200 a year with shares of the fees. The secretary was directed to ascertain from the existing candidates whether they would accept the appointment on the altered footing. Colonel West, Mr R. A. Jones, Captain Verney, and Mr J. Roberts (Bangor) were appointed a committee with the senate to consider and reduce the applications. The appoint- ments of lecturers in biology and Welsh were deferred. -Mr Humphreys-Owen brought up the report of the Charter Committee, which stated that the draft charter was about being submitted to the Privy Council, and after adopting a resolution to the effect that the order of retirement amongst the seventeen members ot the council elected by the court of governors should be decided by law, and the rejection of several amend- ments, the report was adopted.\u2014The following notice of motion had been given That the representatives of the press be admitted to the meetings of the council,\" and it was proposed and seconded, with the addition of the following words :\u2014\" unless excluded by the vote of three-fourths of the members present at any of the meetings of the council.\" The following amendment was proposed and seconded:\u2014\"That, with a view to provide accurate information of the action of the council, the secretary be directed to communicate after each council meeting to the principal papers cir- culating in North Wales an official repjrt of every resolution passed at such meeting, and that, on the requisition of any three members, the names of those voting for or against any motion or amendment shall be recorded and submitted with the minutes to the next meeting of the Court of Governors, who shall publish the names if they think proper, provided that no record shall be taken of the names of any supporter or opposer of any motion or amendment dealing with the election or removal of a professor or lecturer, or affecting the character or status of any individual.\" The amendment was carried, and upon being put as a substantive motion, an amendment was proposed to the effect that after each council meeting the minutes should, upon the requisition of any three members, be communicated to the newspapers, with resolutions, amendments, and names of those voting. This, how- ever, was rejected, and the substantive motion was carried. \u2014 The General Purposes Committee was directed to report the terms on which batches of other educational establishments should be admitted as students of the college.\u2014A motion dealing with the length of the college terms was referred to the Charter and the Statutes Committee. -The Senate was author- ised to award the scholarships about to be competed for and to publish the results.\u2014During the morning, meetings were held of the Charter and Statutes Com- mittee and the Finance Committee.",

This is a neatly bound and printed volume of tbe Victorian Era Series, which is designed to form a record of the great movements and devfiiopraenti= in politics, economics, religion, industry, literature, science and art, and of the lifev. ork of ;ypic&i and influential men of the Victorian Era. Mr J. Holland Rose M.A.. late scholar of Christ's College, Cambridge, is editor of the series, tne volumes of wh'\"h are written and compiled by speciaLy qualified men. The volume under notice is by Dean Sruobs, ot Ely, who givea a full account of the aims aud methods of the Christian Socialists of S:18, and of the in- fluence they weilded in guiding the political and social aspirations of the Chartist movement into the peaceful paths of Trades Unionism and industrial co-operation. The story is, of course, told in close and constant connection with Kingsley's career, not, however, to the exclusion of due reference to kindred spirits of the times, especially of Maurice, who did, perhaps, more than anyone else to mould and develop the Christian Socialist movement. The Science of Life (Blackie and Son). Another edition of the Victorian Ers, Series. The outline of the history of biology given in this volume trace the advances of biology from a position of insignificance to one of pre-eminence moug the sciences. The World's Press and the World's Markets (Henry Sell). This invaluable annnal, published by Mr Henry Sell, guide, philosopher. and friend of all sorts aud conditions of people who have\" wants\" to advertise, appears tnis year in a new form. Having had 18 years of uninterrupted growth, the proportions attained by the publication called for a division of the massive volume with which newspaper men. advertisers, and commercial men generally have been familiar for many years. For the convenience of Mr S\u00e9ll's clients, therefore, the work has been divided into two volumes, one being devoted to the world's Press' and the other to me worla's markets. In this, the nineteenth annual issue, the work furnishes abundant proof of the great pains laken in its compilation, and gives some idea of the complex ramifications of the agency which Mr Sell directs with conspicuous ability. For those re- quiring a, \"Su of papers covering a defined area county lists or papers are provided. There are also lists of magazines and class papers, and papers published in British possessions in Europe, Asia, Australasia, Africa, and America, together with particulars of the principal papers pub- lished in foreign countries. Among other useful features of the dictionary is that of newspaper proprietors' own announcements, giving the scale of charges for advertisements aud other par- ticulars. The volumes, however, have more than a class interest, for they include over 350 pages of special articles and 250 pa^es of useful com- mercial anj general imorma.tion. Among the articles are Parliament and Trade-New Legis- lation in 1898, Inter-British Trade and its Developments, British Insurance, Shipping Kings, Anecdotal History of Journalism, and some old inns with literary associations. The Shipping World Year Book edited by Major Jones (Shipping World Offices). Some useful additions and changes mark the thirteenth issue of this annual, not \"the least important being digests of the Liability of Ship- owners At and the Light Dues and Apprentices Act of 1898. The directory, which appears to be most comprehensive and accurate, embodies the tariffs of all nations, the charges, towage, and pilotage having been revised up to the hour of printine. The large map accompanying the volume shows the routes of steamers and rail- ways the world over and the products, ports, and coalfields of all countries. Standing alone the map affords a liberal education in the world's commerce. Catriona (Cassell and Co.). Among the volumes included in the people's ediiton of famous books issuing from the Cassell Press at sixpence each Stevenson's \"Catriona.\" is certain to have a large sale. -a\" ''V-",

The Presr Association learns that Lord Iveagh is proposing a comprehensive scheme which will probably cost him a quarter of a million sterling for the improvement of the insanitary area in the heart of the city of Dublin. His proposal, which will take the form of a Bill in the coming Session of Parliament, will deal with that part of the Irish Metropolis which is known as the Bull Alley area, forming the centre portion of the district from St. Patrick's Cathedral to Christ- church Cathedral. His Lordship contemplates acquiring the area between Ball Alley and Bride's Alley, and utilising the site partly by giving certain portions to the Dublin Corporation for straightening, widening, and improving adjacent streets, but chiefly for the erection of two classes of buildings, viz., workmen's dwellings, a lodging house for single men, and shops, also certain re- creative buildings such as large concert halls, reading and lecture rooms, swimming bath, and gymnasium. The promoter will execute the whole scheme at his own cost. Eventually the control and management of the property will be vested in the Guinness trustees, who will be prevented from letting or using the recreative buildings for political purposes of a party character or for sectarian meetings. The Press Association has been requested to publish the following communication respecting an offer of a quarter of a million made by Lord Iveagh to the Council of the Jenner Institute, and its acceptance on behalf of that body by Lord Lister and Sir Henry Roscoe We ask permis- sion to announce a splendid offer in aid of scientific research which has been placed in our hands. British and Irishmen of science have long deplored the fact that the opportunities in this eountry for research directed to the prevention of disease are not equal to those possessed by foreign nations. Lord Iveagh wishes to help in removing this reproach to our country, and on the conditions named below has offered the sum of LM,000 for the purposes of the highest research in bacteriology and other forms of biology as bearing upon the cause, nature, pre- vention, and treatment of disease. He has pro- posed to the Council of the Jenner Institute (lately the British Institute) of Preventive Medicine, a body which includes leading men in medicine and allied sciences in the British Isles, that the donation shall be handed over to the institute on condition that in future the control and management of the affairs of the institute shall be placed in the hands of a new board of seven trustees, three of the seven to be chosen by the Council of the institate, three by the donor, and one by the Council of the Royal Society. The offer has been cordially accepted at a meet- ing of the Council. The donor further proposes that part of the new fund shall be appropriated to the enlargement of the buildings of the insti- tute at Chelsea, part to increasing the at present sadly inadequate salaries of the director and other members of the scientific staff, part to the expenses of administration and maintenance, and the remainder chiefly to founding valuable fellowships and studentships, tenable for limited periods of research, either in the laboratories of the institution or in centres of the outbreaks of disease whether at home or abroad. The condi- tions on which these fellowships and studentships may be held are not yetdetennined upon, but it is hoped to open them to all classes of her Majesty's subjects. Lord Iveagh, in our opinion, deserves the gratitude of the nation for thus munificently providing for the cultivation in the British dominion of biology and allied sciences for the good of mankind in an institution which hence- forth will compare favourably with any similar establishments in other parts of the world. We have the honour to be, sir, your obedient servants, Lister, chairman of Council; Henry E. Roscoe, hon. treasurer.\"",

Treasurer. \"December 22. LORD. IVBAOH'S SCIIEMK FOR IWPROYJN'F; NRT-R.RS. Lord Iveagh's comprehensive philnnthrophic scheme, which was announced some time nsro. and which has for its object the improvement of an in- sanitary area in the heart of the city of Dublin, will, it is stated, probably cost him a quarter of a million sterling. The proposal, which is to take the form of a bill j sterling. The proposal, which is to take the form of a bill j in the coming session of Parli;imer;f. will deal with that part of the Irish metropolis which is known ns the Bull-alley area, forming the centre portion of the district from St. Patrick's Cathedral to Cbri'stchurch I Cathedral. His lordship contemplates acquiring the area In- tween Bull-alley and Bride's-allev, and utilising the site partly by giving certain portions to the Corpora- tion of Dublin for the straishtemng, widening, improving of the adjacent streets, but chiefly for the erection of two classes of buildings, viz: (1) Workmen's dwellings, a lodging-house for single men, shops, &c. (2) Certain recreatrve buildings, such as a concert, hall, reading and lectnre rooms, swimming bath, gymnasium, &c. The promoter will execute the whole scheme at his own cost, but without personally deriving any pecu- niary profit from it, and eventually the control and management of the property is to be handed over to the trustees of the Guinness Trust for the amelio- ration of the condition of the labouring classes in Dublin. His lordship's wish and intention are that the in- come derivable from the scheme shall be available in part as an endowment, to permif the concert-hall nnd other buildings for recreative purposes to be used t times for the benefit of the poor inhabitants of Dublin at prices within their means, or wholly or in part gratuitously, but not to the exclusion of other classes from the use of such buildings for re- creative purposes, at reasonable and ordinary scales of payment. The trustees are to be prevented from letting or using the recreative buildings for political purposes of a party character or for sectarian meetings. The Bull-alley area is about three acres in extent. It has already been condemned as an insanitary area by the Dublin medical officer of health. The proposed concert-hall will be designed to seat about 1000 persons. It will be provided with an organ and with the necessary instilments. &c.. for a good orchestra, as an organist and bmdmaster are to he appointed, whose duties will include the train- ing of an orchestra and choir from both sexes of the inhabitants of the district at no expense to tha pupils. The Corporation of Dublin have conveyed their heartiest thanks to the promoter, and have expressed their belief that the scheme should prove most bene- ficial to the interests of the city, particularly as re- gards the inhabitants of the congested districts in the neighbourhood of the area affested by the proposed scheme.",

All other questions must be put on the shelf inexorably till that of unemployment wag settled. The Socialist was not an extraor- dinary person. He was merely an obser- vant animal, who saw an object in the streets and did not content himself with seeing the object, but saw through it and philosophised on it. Some time a.go Parlia- ment were asked to consider the question of feeding the school-children. They said, \"We have no time. We have an overlapping pro- gramme. We have legislative indigestion, and we cannot spare a half-day to devote to the feeding of ohildren.\" (\"Shame.\") It was not a week after that that the Houae of Commons was wasting a couple of hours congratulating the Prince of WaJos on the birth of a child. (\"Shame.\") btarving Dog Parallel Mr. Grayson continued: The Premier, John Barns, and Winet.on Churchill all said there will be no legislation for unemployment this year. Oh, get a poor starving dog and starve him until yon have starved him almost to a skeleton, and when the dog makes a bound for you, determined to have food, you say to that dog: \"There will be mo food this year; we have an overcrowded programme.\" The dog wiKL remind you of its underorowded stomach. Then when the dog bites, you shout, \"Order, order!\" I would break the most eacred law on God's earth if tha4 law aMod between a human being and a meal. I believe that to die of starvation m the kund of plenty wouid disgrace the most priTrritive people who ever lived. We do not wan t to feed the loafer when the loa,fer- hae a chance to work t^nd on medical inepectioai is found fit and only mentally indisposed. I would commit him to the lethal chamber with as little compunction as I would kil a rat. I do not love a loaier, but I tell you that when they counted the dead bodies afterwards there would be UIQl\" aristocrats amongst them than people of the lower classes. (Cheers, groans, and prolonged interruiptkme.) They (the Socialists), continued Mr. Grayson, toid the Government they believed they knew how this problem of \"un\u00abnipioyment could be solved. They might not be right. He merely stated they had worried out a way of solving the problem. They thought it was right. They were willing to give their lives for it, and they asked for a trial to find out how to solve unemployment. They would no longer conduct t-hemeelvee decoT- ously to society of society refused them the last chance of feeding the hungry poimla- tion. If one man starved they all felt braaided with the brand of murder. A Parasite.\" I Questions were invited at the close, and promptly came the query, What did you call the King the other day?\" Mr. Grayson answered: I think the term I used was a term well known in biology-a parasite. (Prolonged hooting.) A parasite is an organism that draws its sustenance from another organism. I have not the slightest objection to the King. I might be in favour of sosae decorative sym- bol under Socialism of a simil-ar kind. All capitalists are parasites. The King draws rent, interest, and profits out of investments in land and compaaties. Bents and profits are exclusively produced by labour, and the person who takes them to live on while others create them is known in biology as a parasite, and I have applied it to sociology.\" The Insults of Ananias.\" I Mr. \"Jack\" Williams, speaking on Friday at a demonstration of the unemployed on Tower Hill, said time after time on the floor of the House of Commons the working class had been insmlted, and even while I/abour members sat and listened, raising no protest whatever. John Burns had called them a drunken lot. After tolling them that they spent seven bob a week on beer, he went further, and said that the unemployed of England were more drunken than the unemployed of America. They were asked to put up with the insults of Ananias, and not uee any strong language.",

A tumult had been going on because of a certain breach of law and order. His reply was that the first breach of law and order was committed when the upper and middle classes filebez from the workers the means to live. All other questions must be put on the shelf inexorably till that of unemployment was settled. The Socialist was not a.n extraor- dinary person. He was merely a-n obser- vant animal, who saw an object in the streets and did not content himself with seeing the object, but saw through it and philosophised on it. Some time ego Parlia- ment were asked to consider the question of feeding the school-children. They said, \"We have no time. We have an overlapping pro- gramme. We have legislative indigestion, and we cannot spare a half-day to devote to the feeding of children.\" (\"Shame.\") It was not a week after that that the House of Commons was wasting a couple of hours congratulating the Prince of aleis on the birth of a cirild. (\"Shame.\") Starving Dog Parallel I Mr. wavy-son continued: The Premier, John Burns, a.nd Winston Churchill all said there will be no legislation for unemployment this year. Oh, get a poor starving dog a,nd starve him until you have starved him almoet to a skeleton, and when the dog mokes a bound for you, determined to have food, you say to that dog: \"There will be mo food this year; we have an overcrowded programme.\" The dog wild remind you of its underorowded stomach. Then when the dog bites, you shout, \"Order, order!\" I would break the most sacred law on God's earth if thaA law stood between a hninaan bei-ng and a meal. I believe that to die of staj-va-ticm in the la.nd of plenty would disgrace the most primitiYe people who ever lived. We do not want to feed the loafer when the loafer ha.s a ebapxe to work BPJd on medical inspection is found fit and only mentally indisposed. I would commit him to the lethal chamber with as little compunction as I would lcil a rat. I do not love a loafer, but I tell you that when they counted the dead bodies afterwards there would be more aa-istocarats amongst them than people of the tower classes. (Cheers, groa-ne, amd prolonged interruptione.) They (the Socialists), continued Mr. Grayson, told the Government they believed they knew how this problem of unemployment could be solved. They might not be right. He merely stated they had worried out a way of solving the problem. They thought it was right. They were willing to give their livec f-or it, and thsy asked for a trial to find out how to solve unemployment. They would no longer conduct themselves decor- ously to society of society refused them the last chance of feeding the hungry -popular tion. If one man starved they all felt bra-nded with the brand of murder. A Parasite.\" I Questions were invited at the olose, and promp-tly carue the query, What did you c-all the King the other day?\" Mr. Grayson answered: I think the term I used was a term well known in biology-a parasite. (Prolonged hooting.) A parasite is am organism that draws its sustenance from another organism. I have not the slightest objection to the King. I might be in favour of scuae decorative sym- bol unde.r Socialism of a similar kind. All capitalists are para/sites. The King draws rent, interest, amd profits out of investments in land and compadies. Rents and profits a-re exclTzsively produced by labour, and the person, who takes them to live on while others create them is known in biology as a parasite, and I have applied it to sociology.\" The Insults of Ananias.\" 't I Mr. \"Jack\" Williams, speaking on Friday at a demonstration of the unemployed on Tower Hill, said time after time on the floor of the House of Commons the working class had been insulted, and even while I/abour members sat and listened, raising no protest whatever. John Burns had called them a drunken lot. After telling them that they spent seven bob a week on beer, he went further, and said that the unemployed of England were more drunken than the unemployed of America. They were asked to put up with the insults of Ananias, and not uwe any strong language.",

                "full_text": "THE REV. JOSEPH COOK. I BY NONCON. QUILL. Mv jottings for last week having been written before I had the pleasure of hearing the Rev- Joseph Cook, the celebrated Boston lecturer, now on a visit to this country, my reference to him is a week late. Nevertheless, I feel it incumbent upon me to say a few words about him and his mission- Having seen frequent allusions to him in the religious newspapers of the day, and come across some stray lectures of his, I had conceived considerable admiration of him. I, there- fore, looked forward to his visit to Cardiff with unfeigned pleasure. I was present in the Wood, street Chapel in good time on Monday night and was somewhat disappointed because of {the thin attendance of the public the first night, though it must be confessed the audience was large and influential the second night. In America, lectures, it appears, are popu- lar institutions, and lecturers are handsomely re- munerated. But in this country, anyone engaging a popular lecturer runs the serious risk of suffer- ing a heavy pecuniary loss. But as the attendance on Tuesday evening compensated in some degree for that of the previous evening, I shall do no more than express a hope that the Cardiff people will evince a little more interest in what tends to enlighten and instruct than they generally do. Their love of political parties, their love of re- ligious sects, their love of money is great, but their love of instruction infmitesimally small. The Rev. Joseph Cook is a \"scribe instructed into the kingdom of heaven,\" having spent thirteen years in consecutive study in the colleges of America and Germany, and ten years or more in studying the subjects which form the substance of his lectures. Know- ing all that, I expected to see on the platform a delicate, slender, consumptive-looking student, with a countenance sicklied o'er with the pale hue of thought.\" However, I saw nothing of the kind, but a burly, brusque man, carrying about him much more earth than ordinary mortals. You might take him for a well-to-do farmer of the Vale of Glamorgan\u2014happy, contented, well-fed, a large shareholder in our veritable flesh and blood. One look at him, and you felt you were looking at a man, a thorough man, a full-blooded, and, as we shall presently see, a full-thoughted man. The scholar has not swallowed the man, the man has swallowed the scholar. This impression remains all through, that you are looking at and listening to a man, a genuine sharer of our common nature. He convinces you of his fellowship with you as a man rather than of his separation from you as a thinker. When he begins to speak, it is not the speech of the elegant scholar or the polished man of the world which strikes you, but a homely, broad farm-like accent, with a dash of Americanism in the enunciation. Had he been educated in Eng- land he would, doubtless, have cultivated greater refinement of voice and manner; his pronuncia- tion would have been more polished. But Mr. Cook is an American, displaying all the vigour of the British or American oak, but without the out- ward polish of which the oak is capable smoothed, cut, shaped he has been, but of veneer he has none. I am no admirer of veneer or varnish I have a deep dislike of mincing pronunciation; I hate all affectation in speech and con- duct for which reason I found myself in profound accord at once with the rev. lecturer from Boston. The first night many words escaped my closest, attention, partly because of my position, slightly behind the speaker, and partly because of the peculiarity of the New England ac- cent. I remember reading a description of Henry Ward Beecher in some newspaper a few years ago- Knowing him to be the most eloquent extempore speaker living, the writer of the article remarked in him the same absence of fine, elegant, perhaps artificial polish of enunciation he spoke as an or- dinary English farmer, the grammar of course cor- rect, the diction choice and rich, the style exhi- biting all the varied hues of the rainbow, the voice flexible and powerful, but the pronunciation plain and destitute of any aristocratic, or affected, or fine-spun intonation. I write thus to show that nationality much influences our style of public speaking. The subjects Mr. Cook selects for his lectures generally lie on the border-land of science and theology..He does not profess to bo an authority on scientific subjects, but he does profess to know accurately what the authorities say. He does not carry on experiments himself, but he has a de- fcailed knowledge of the results of experiments con- ducted by professional experts. Men of science a year or two ago raised a wild howl against his in- terference. What does he, a theologian, know about science ? they asked, contemptuously. Our first answer is, Mr. Cook only professes to know what the best scientific men have written; he never makes a statement but he quotes his autho- rity, and though his lectures on biology have been published for two or three years, no inaccurate or false statement has yet been detected. What do theologians know about science ? again ask the scientists. My second answer is\u2014theo- logians know as much about science as scientists know about theology. Huxley and Tyndall are. I readily concede, great authorities on the subjects which they have specially studied, but when they sneer at theologians and profess to write authori- tatively on the question, say of the Sabbath, as one of them has done within the last month or two, they are mere tyros playing the popes. Any- one reading the essay referred to, with only a modicum of Scriptural training, must be astonished at the combination in the author of arrogance and ignorance. In their particular lines they are authorities, and deserve great honour; but when they continually intrude, as their manner is, to the domain of religion and launch their crude notions\u2014why, the driest stick of a preacher in the Principality can laugh them to scorn. Among them that are born of women there hath not arisen, perhaps, greater men than they in the realm of science, though Mr. Cook and others are told enough to declare Carpenter, Beale, and others as more eminent and more deserving of the confidence of scholars notwithstanding that, \"he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than they.\" Fashion sways among literary men as among ladies; and the fashion of late has been to magnify Tyndall and Huxley as supreme authorities in all kinds of knowledge, human and Divine; but this fashion, like other fashions, must come to an end. The fashion in France has been to eulogise everything which proceeded from the pen of Victor Hugo but since M. Zola had the courage to speak honestly his thoughts, everybody turns round and echoes his sentiments. \u2022\" Victor Hugo has been, and will remain, our greatest lvric poet,\" says the bold critic, \"but thinker, philosopher, savant never!\" Never,\" echoes the French nation. One true word honestly spoken is likely to change the estimate of the French nation of the great romancist, and some critic will arise, and the time is not far distant saying, Messrs. Huxley and Tyndall, you are \"doubtless giants in science you have done much to advance and popularise scienca but you have done wrong in carrying your scientific authority to theological questions; for a while you have deluded the public, but the public will awake and discern the difference between authority in science and authority in religion. Because you understand the biology of a frog, it does not follow that you understand the biology of a God.\" Evidently the subject of Mr. Cook's last lecture created much interest, \"Does death end all?\" He began with the moral argument, the moral in. stinct anticipating a world beyond the grave. God has never created an instinct but He has pro- vided for its legitimate gratification. An instinct in the fIsh-water to match it. A migrating in- stinct in the bird\u2014a South to meet it. Conscience pointing to a world beyond the skies\u2014a world there to match it. No half joints in the creation. Though there is nothing absolutely new in this argument, yet the old argument was so dexter- ously put as to carry overwhelming conviction to the minds of the hearers. To me, this portion of the lecture was the most eloquent and convincing. Then he moved on to the biological argument. Though the facts adduced seemed indisputable, yet the lecturer seemed, despite himself, to prove too much. The argument, which proved the immortality of man, proved also the immortality of the lower animals. This Relief was cherished by Agassiz, the great naturalist; Butler, the author of the \"Analogy,\" and I remember Dr. Goodwin, the Puritan divine, throws out the same idea in his \"Notes on the Revelations.\" Personally, I should not object to the truth of this suggestion; though I verily believe that many an old niggardly saint would never have the courage to face his ox or his ass in the Great Day. \".William,\" asked the Rev. Thomas Richards, of Fishguard, of the groom! \"have vou given oats to the nag?\" \"Yes, sir.\" Are you sure, William for the nag will meet you again on the Judgment Day, before the Judgment seat.\" If he do, sir, the first thing he will do when he sees me will be to neigh for more oats.\" At all events, Mr. Cook seems to weight his argu- ment very heavily. Whereas he arrives at the conclusion of the immortality of the animals, Mr. Edward White and his school have arrived at the conclusion of the mortality of souls. The truth, I believe, lies between.",

Chevruel, the veteran chemist, who has been a member of the Academy of sciences since 1826. THE DANGER OF TORNADOES.\u2014Owing to the fre- quency of tornadoes in some parts of the Valley of the Mississippi, we understand that a number of caves have been bored in some parts of the country to afford shelter to travellers chancing to meet such dangerous pheno- mena on their way. THE LATE EARL RUSSELL.\u2014In addition to former gifts of likenesses of his famous contemporaries, Mr. Watts proposes shortly to present to the National Por- trait Gallery a fine and expressi ve bead-unfmished, but full of character and beautifully painted \u2014of Lord John (Earl) Russell. It is nearly in profile to our right, and of the size of life. THE LATE COLONEL BURNAHY.\u2014Miss Reed's portrait of the late Colonel Burnaby has been purchased by Mrs. Burnaby, but before it passed into Mrs. Burnaby's possession an etching was made from it by Miss E. A. Armstrong. The transcript into black and white hag been truthfully and happily rendered. AN ANCIENT STOHL-In the muniment toom of the Fairfax family at Newton Kyme there were several boxes in which had been buried for many scores of years the life-story of a man who had played an active part in his generation. He had seen much service, and had held honourable positions both afloat and ashore. That man was Robert Fairfax of Steeton, vice-admiral, and member for York, 1666-1725. The chronicle ot his life has been arranged by Mr. Clemsnt R. Markham. A GERMAN WORK.\u2014Eucyclopiedia\u00abmaking is still a rage among the literati of Germany. Scarcely a month passes without a voluminous work of some kind being announced or as having been taken in hand. The latest work of this kind is an \"Allgemeine Naturkunde\" \u2014natural history in its broadest sense\u2014which will fill seven or eight volumes, three being devoted to The History of the Earth,\" two to \"Plant Life and Man,\" and three to Ethnology.\" The work will be issued by the Bibliographisches Institut of Leipzig. LONDON UNIVERSITY.\u2014To meet the requirements of ladies going up to the Preliminary Scientific or the Intermediate or Full B.Sc. examination at the Uni- versity of London, under the new lobulations, the Council of Bedford College, York-place, Baker-street, London, have arranged for a complete course of in- struction in biology, to commence next October. Mr. A. G. Bourne will give lectures in animal biology, and will also have classes for demonstration. Mr. A. W. Bennet will lecture on vegetable biology, and Miss Mary Forster, of Newnham College, will give practical demonstrations twice a week. Provision is also made for adequate instruction in other branches of science required for the same examinations, viz., mathematics, physics and chemistry, the two latter including labo- ratory work. THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.\u2014The additions to the Zoological Gardens during the past week include a. bonnet monkey from India, presented by Mrs. Cooper; an Erxleben's monkey from West Africa, presented by Miss Peers; a blue-fronted amazon from South America, presented by Lady Kensington; a Rendall's guinea- fowl from West Africa, presented by Mr. F. Le Sueur; three razorbills, eight puffins from Ireland, presented by the Rev. Ed. Weldon a long-eared owl. European, presented by Mr. E. Allen three angulated tortoises, an areolated tortoise from South Africa; a black sternothere from West Africa, presented by the Rev. G.H. K. Fisk, C.M.Z.S.; two king vultures from tropical America, deposited an axis deer, aduyker-bok born in the gardens. Nature.\" A CURIOSITY FOR MADAME TUSSAUDS.\u2014A Paris corre- spondent states that a remarkable use has just been made of the identical bath in which the notorious Marat was assassinated by Charlotte Corday. This curious and interesting relic by some means or other passed into the hands of an elderly priest in Brittany, the Abbe Le Cosse, who has now detemined to sell it, and to devote the proceeds of the sale to works of charity in trs parish. He has already received large orders from curiosity-hunters and collectors of old- fashioned souvenirs, but has not yet parted with his peculiar relic. DISCOVERIES IN EHPESUS.\u2014An extra-sessional meet- ing of the Royal Society of Literature was held in their rooms in Delahav-street, in order to hear some observa- tions from Mr. J, T. Wood in regard to his discoveries by excavation at Ephesus. After tracing the many conjectural attempts which had been made to fix the site of the celebrated Temple of Diana, Mr. Wood re- lated how, after a long series of tentative efforts, ex- tending over several years, he had at last struck upon the track which led from the Shaguesian gate to the Temple and had found the foundations of the wall built in the time of Augustus Cajsar by Gallus, the pro-consul, round the sacred precincts and out of the reveaues of the Temple. On the last day of 1869 the workmen srruck upon the pavement and sculptured figures, and since that period discoveries have gradually been made making it possible pretty nearly to ascertain the form and dimensions of the entire building. Many other most interesting relics of the ancient city have also been unearthed, among them the almost undoubted tomb of St. Luke. LAST WEEK'S WRECKS.\u2014The past week was notable for the number of collisions and loss of life. Only seven British vessels were reported a\" actual wrecks, but of these four went down by colliding off the British coasts. Ten foreign vessels were wrecked, one sinking by collision off Spain with loss of three lives. Total less of life off British Isles by collision, 15. and total wrecks six (five British and one Italian). A British sailer and a French sailer were reported lost with all hands. Two foreign sailers abandoned at sea. Wrecks for year, 638. Corresponding week of last year: Wrecks, 19; total for year, 872. Lives lost 200 (lives lost by collision, 150). CALIFORNIA AS AN OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRY. California is now third in the list of petroleum-pro- ducing States of the United States. Pennsylvania leads, and New York is second. After California come West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky. A little oil is ob- tained in Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico, although not much has been found in the latter places. California is gradually increasing her production, as new wells are opened in Southern California, and the industry is now a prosperous one there. As far back as 1b78, 15.227 barrels were produced. In 1879 this in- creased to 19,858 barrels; 1880 showed returns of 42,399 barrels; 50,000 barrels in 1881; and 70,000 in 1882. The year 1883 showed an increase, and in 1884 the produc- tion was over 100,000 barrels. A barrel is uniformly 42 gallons. California consumes all the oil produced, and about 100,000 gallons per annum from the east as well. \u2014\" Iron.\" VISIT OF PRINCE JA JA TO ENGLAND.\u2014Within the next few days another African prince will visit this country. The prince in question is a son of King Ja Ja, of Opobo. His full name is Saturday Ja, Ja. He is now on his way in the British and African Steam Navigation Company's steamer Teneriffe. which is due at Liverpool next Thursday. King Ja Ja, it will be re- membered, is the great rival of Oko Jumbo, and the oatcies between the followers of each monarch have been many and sanguinary. Prince Ja Ja comes, it is understood, to consult some English doctors respecting his eyes. During his stay in this country the prince will be the proteg; of Mr. Charles de Cardi, a well- know;-k African merchant of Liverpool. King Ja Ja. has several sons who are named after the days of the week. AMERICAN LIVE STOCK AND FRESH MEAT \u2014The past week's arrivals at Liverpool of live stock and fresh meat from American and Canadian ports amounted to 3170 cattle, 1877 sheep, 7936 quarters of beef, and 350 causes of mutton, and which figures, in comparison, with those of the preceding week, show a slight decrease in the imports of both live stock and fresh meat. The conveying steamers were as followsKansas, 807 cattle and 960 quarters of beef; Iberian, 470 cattle and 784 quarters of beef; Norseman, 584 cattle and 912 quarters of beef Toronto, 387 cattle and 1114 sheep; Circassian, 248 cattle and 182 sheep; Numida, 200cattle; Lake Champlain, 290 cattle and581 sheep-' Guillprnao, 184 cattle; Indiana, 1200 quarters of beef; Baltic, 740 quarters of beef and -100 carcases of mutton; Wyoming, 2600 quarters of beef and 17S. carcases of mutton; and Celtic, 720 quarters of beef and 75 carcases of mutton.",

The latest work of this kind is an \"Allgemeine Naturkunde'r -natural history in its broadest sense-which will fill seven or eight volumes, three being devoted to The History of the Earth,\" two to\" Plant Life and Man,\" and three to Ethnology.\" The work will be issued by the Bibliographisches Institut of Leipzig. LONDON UNIVERSITY.\u2014To meet the requirements of ladies going up to the Preliminary Scientific or the Intermediate or Full B.Sc. examination at the Uni- versity of London, under the new legulations, the Council of Bedford College, York-place, Baker-street, London, have arranged for a complete course of in- struction in biology, to commence next October. Mr. A. G. Bourne will give lectures in animal biology, and will also have classes for demonstration. Mr. A. W. Bennet will lecture on vegetable biology, and Miss Mary Forster, of Newnham College, will give practical demonstrations twice a week. Provision is also made for adequate instruction in other branches of science required for the same examinations, viz., mathematics, physics and chemistry, the two latter including labo- ratory work. THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.\u2014The additions to the Zoological Gardens during the past week include a- bonnet monkey from India, presented by Mrs. Cooper; an Erxleben's monkey from West Africa, presented by Miss Peers; a blue-fronted amazon from South America, presented by Lady Kensington; a Rendall's guinea- fowl from West Africa, presented by Mr. F. Le Sueur; three razorbills, eight puffins from Ireland, presented by the Rev. Ed. Weldon; a long-eared owl, European, presented by Mr. F. Allen three angulated tortoises, an areolated tortoise from South Africa; a black sternothere from West Africa, presented by the Rev. G.H. K. Fisk, C.M.Z.S.; two king vultures from tropical America, deposited an axis deer, a duyker-bok born in the gardens.\u2014 Nature.\" A CURIOSITY you MADAME TUSSAUDS.\u2014A Paris corre- spondent states that a remarkable use has just been made of the identical bath in which the notorious Marat was assassinated by Charlotte Corday. This curious and interesting relic by some means or other passed into the hands of an elderly priest in Brittany, the Abb6 Le Cosse, who has now detemined to sell it, and to devote the proceeds of the sale to works of charity in h;s parish. He has already received large orders from curiosity-hunters and collectors of old- fashioned souvenirs, but has not yet parted with his peculiar relic. DISCOVERIES IN EHPESUS.\u2014An extra-sessional meet- ing of the Royal Society of Literature was held in their rooms in Delahay-street,in order to hear some observa- tions from Mr. J. T. Wood in regard to his discoveries by excavation at Ephesus. After tracing the many conjectural attempts which had been made to fix the site of the celebrated Temple of Diana, Mr. Wood re- lated how, after a long series of tentative efforts, ex- tending over several years, he had at last struck upon the track which led from the Shaguesian gate to the Temple and had found the foundations of the wall built in the time of Augustus Osesar by Gallus, the pro-consul, round the sacred precincts and out of the revenues of the Temple. On the last day of 1869 the workmen struck upon the pavement and sculptured figures, and since that period discoveries have gradually been made making it possible pretty nearly to ascertain the form and dimensions of the entire building. Many other most interesting relics of the ancient city have also been unearthed, among them the almost undoubted tomb of St. Luke. B LAST WEEK'S WRECKS.\u2014The past week was potable for the number of collisions and loss of life. Only seven British vessels were reported as actual wrecks, but of these four went down by colliding off the British coasts. Ten foreign vessels were wrecked, one sinking by collision off Spain with loss of three lives. Total foss of life off British Isles by collision, 15, and total wrecks six (five British and one Italian). A British sailer and a French sailer were reported lost with all hands. Two foreign sailers abandoned at sea. Wrecks for year, 638. Corresponding week of last year: Wrecks, 19 total for year, 872. Lives lost 200 (lives lost by collision, 150). CALIFORNIA AS AN OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRY. \u2014 California is now third in the list of petroleum-pro- ducing States of the United States. Pennsylvania leads, and New York is second. After California come West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky. A little oil is ob- tained in Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico, although not much has been found in the latter places. California is gradually increasing her production, as new wells are opened ia Southern California, and the industry is now a prosperous one there. As far back as 1878,15.227 barrels were produced. In 1879 this in- Creased to 19,858 barrels; 1880 showed returns of 42,399 barrels; 50,000 barrels in 1881; and 70,000 in 1882. The year 1883 showed an increase, and in 1884 the produc- tion was over 100,000 barrels. A barrel is uniformly 42 gallons. Califor iia consumes all the oil produced, and about 100,000 gallons per annum from the east as well. \u2014\" Iron.\" VISIT OF PRINCE JA JA TO ENGLAND.-Within the next few days another African prince will visit this country. The prince in question is a son of King Ja Ja, of Opobo. His full name is Saturday Ja Ja. He is now on his way in the British and African Steam Navigation Company's steamer Teneriffe, which is due at Liverpool next Thursday. King Ja Ja, it will be re- membered, is the great rival of Oko Jumbo, and the battles between the followers of each monarch have been many and sanguinary. Prince Ja Ja comes, it is understood, to consult some English doctors respecting \u2022 his eyes. During his stay in this country the prince will be the protege of Mr. Charles de Cardi, a well- known African merchant of Liverpool. King Ja Ja. has several sons who are named after the days of the week. AMERICAN LIVE STOCK AND FRESH MEAT \u2014The pasf\u00bb week's arrivals at Liverpool of live stock and fresh meats from American and Canadian ports amounted to 31701; cattle, 1877 sheep, 7936 quarters of beef, and 355 carcases of mutton, and which figures, in comparison with those of the preceding week, show a slight decrease in the imports of both live stock and fresh meat. The conveying steamers were as follows:\u2014Kansas, 80t cattle and 960 quarters of beef; Iberian, 470 cattle and 784 quarters of beef; Norseman, 584 cattle and 912 quarters of beef Toronto, 387 cattle and 1114 sheep; Circassian, 248 cattle and 182 sheep; Numida, 200 cattle; Lake Champlain, 290 cattle and 581 sheep; Guillermo, 181 cattle; Indiana, 1200 quarters of beef; Baltic, 740 quarters of beef and 100 carcases of mutton; WyomiDg, 2600 quarters of beef and 175 carcases of mutton; and Celtic, 720 quarters of beef and 75 carcases of mutton.",

BOROUGHS' ELECTION.\u2014The executive of the Monmouth- shire Railway and Canal Company, have issued a circular to their different officer, strictly forbidding any exercise of the company's influence witli persons employed in the under- taking, with the view of coercing thern in the disposition of their votes at the ensuing election it is desired that any infringement of the order be reported to the chief clerk. The proprietors of the largest manufacturing establishment adjoining Newport, are said to have adopted the same honor- able course.\u2014 Communicated. THE LATE MEETING AT THE DOCK.-A correspondent, who was present at the last meeting called by Mr. Lindsay's friends, at the dock, remarks tli;it Mr.Batchelor made no obser- vation, in reference to the Conservative candidata, which warranted Mr. O'Reilly's saying that the threshold of private life was invaded. NEWPORT DispEKSARV.-If appears, by advertisement, that a meeting of the subscribers to that admirable institu- tion, the Newport Dispensary, is appointed to take place at the Town-hall, on the 24th instant. With reference to the sum deposited in the Monmouth and Gflamorgan Bank, which had been gathered by the untiring exertions of the honorary secretary, and intended as a nucleus for the great work of erecting an Infirmary in this advancing town,-though we take it for granted there will be no voice against accepting the composition which the company have fortunately been enabled to offer, yet we do not abandon the hope that circum- stances may yet arise, and at no far-distant day, which will enable the managers of the Bank affairs to restore the sacred fund in its totality. \\Ve have now before us the annual reports of the charity from the year 1843, when Mr. Williams, happily for the cause of humanity, commenced his services; and the extraordinary progress in the sphere ot usefulness, which the institution has made in the time, must cheer him on in his future labours of love, and warm the hearts of cheerful givers. NEWPORT ATHEN.EUM.\u2014On Tuesday evening last, C. E. Bernard, Esq., of Cardiff, C.E., delivered a very interesting and instructive lecture, on Mathematical Studies, illustrated by numerous diagrams, which afforded means of popularly demonstrating propositions, which ordinarily present dis- couraging difficulties. We regretted that a very limited number were present, to benefit by the talented lecturer's instructions, for every acquisition in science should be sought for, and received with an ardour proportionate to its use. Mr. Bernard is gifted witli a clear and pleasing enunciation, attractive manners, and a logical accuracy of reasoning. Ihe vote of thanks for his valuable lecture, (proposed by Mr. Jones, and seconded by Mr. Jack,) was accompanied by hearty cheers. ADJOURNED QUARTER SESSIONS.\u2014Thase sessions, for which there is a considerable number of prisoners for trial, (but no county business to be transacted, or appeals heard,) will be commenced at Usk next Tuesday morning, at ten o'clock. Mr. Charles Phillips's usual coach accommodation, we perceive by advertisement, will be at the service of the public. MONMOUTH AND GLAMORGAN BANKING COMPANY.\u2014It will be seen by advertisement in our paper, that the Master in Chancery intends forthwith to form a list of the members of this company, and, to save expense, a preliminary meeting will take place at the Town-hall, Newport, on the 3rd March, at twelve o'clock. Any shareholder having a sub- stantial objection to his being placed on the list of members, should attend this meeting, and state his objections to the Master's chief clerk, by which probably much inconvenience and expense may be avoided to all parties. FURIOUS DRIVING.\u2014On Saturday last, as a servant of Mr. Scandrett, butcher, Commercial-street, was driving up from the shop towards the market, at the customary dashing pace of butchers' boys when driving or riding, at the bottom of Hill-street, a little boy, son of Mr. Collings, painter, Hill-street, whilst crossing over the road, was knocked down by the horse, occasioning some injuries (none of which were serious), to the poor child. LOCAL NEWS.-rThe Newport police report; county court report; Mr. Superintendent Jeremiah's (of Brynmawr) defence Choral Societies (Chepstow), &c., &c., will be found in our second and third pages. ELECTRO BIOLOGY.\u2014Mr. Barnett has been exhibiting the marvellous science\" of electro-biology to numerous audi- ences, at the Town-hall, during Ite week. Much amusement was afforded, and astonisment caused, by the effects which the lecturer produced on those of the audience who submitted to his manipulations, and were found to be susceptible and the various phenomena presented in the mesmeric state. Mr. Barnett, has, we understand, latelv obtained several proselytes to electro-biology, whilst with others, seeing is not believing CAUTION.-Persons who disagree with each other, on county court days, should not do so in the immediate hearing of the Judge, and to his Honour's interruption and annoyance. On Wednesday, a noisy fellow, immediately after his case was adjourned, quarrelled so loudly, and with so much earnestness, with his opponent, at the very portal of justice, that the Judge directed him to be taken into custody at once, and locked up till the rising of the Court. This softened the man's tone considerably, and he was taken off by Wilson, the bailiff, much chagrined. THE DOCKS.\u2014We are very glad to find that an improve- ment in the trade of the port, has taken place within the last few days. The dulness and stagnation had been quite dis- couraging; merchants had time to canvass (electioneeringly) or to converse with those who came to canvass them for the respective candidates, whilst many unemployed hobblers, and other hardy workmen, appeared idly grouped about Pill- gwenlly and the wharfs, looking channel-ward for the tall masts. Ships are now in goodly number, loading coal and iron at the dock, and amongst the merchant fleet that has arrived at our port this week, Mr. Lindsay has a direct interest in seven of the larger class. BOOK-KEEPING.\u2014In one of the cases tried by the Judge of the Newport County Court this week, a plaintiff's account ran thus: \"The Irishwoman-tobacco, id.; and id. lent, and that makes one penny.\" Numerous other items in the same \"ledger\" were equally circumstantial. PUBLIC MEETING OF WORKING MEN ON WEDNESDAY EVENING.\u2014A numerously-attended meeting of working men was held at the large room of the George and Dragon, at which a deputation, consisting of Messrs. L. Edwards, T. M. Llewellin, H. Sheppard, W. Naish, T. Harris, &c-, &c., from the Westgate committee, were present. The object of the meeting was to explain the principles upon which Mr. Lind- say sought the sutlrages of the electors, and to advance that gentleman's interest by the formation ot a committee ot working men in that quarter of the town. Mr. L. Edwards presided. V ery animated addresses were delivered by the Chairman, Mr. Llewellin, Mr. Jones, a working shoemaker, Mr. Davies, clothier, Mr. Sheppard, Mr. Chatterley, and others and an enthusiastic feeling was exhibited by the working men present, for the success ot the Liberal interest, and the return of Mr. Lindsay for the boroughs- ihe meet- ing concluded by a vote of thanks to the Chairman. Mr. Pitt, bookseller, then announced that the Bush Working Men's Committee were then assembled at that inn, and the attendance of the Pentonville Committee for a short time was requested. We understand that the two committees made the necessary arrangements for active operat.oistnthe part of each.\u2014On Thursday (last evening) a meeting took place at the large room of the Sunderland Inn, Llanarth-street, Mr. Lewis, draper, presiding; when addresses (in Welsh) were delivered in support of Mr. Lindsay's claims, thelcading object being to secure the co-operation of the Welsh portion of the electors. The meeting was numerously attended and decided expressions of adherence to Mr. Lindsay's interest, were recorded. TAKE CAUE !-The approach of summer naturally awaken apprehensions as to the probable prevalence of disease of a malignant character, unless early, indeed, immediate measures are adopted to improve drainage, remove all surface nui- sances, and make a general sanitary improvement, so far as practicable, in bye-lanes, courts, alleys, and other pi; ces where tilth and disease are common in the summer season. The surveyor and inspector of nuisances, and his staff, .\u00bbill, no doubt, proceed to work with great activity. An irwPligent and active Guardian, has expressed to us his apprehensions, that the apathy and supiueness which appear to have suc- ceeded the exertions of the Board of Health during the dread affliction of cholera here, will lead to the worst conse- quences in generating malignant disease in neglectedneigh- bourhoods. There were, at the close of last week, thirty-six cases of fever at the hospital, Stow Hill.",

He finds it as hard to jriite a good play as many literary imitators find It to imitnte his exquisite verses. Nevertheless ie seems determined to succeed, and is trying igaiu,\" with all the earnestness and skill of a man y C, igaiu,\" with all the earnestness and skill of a man who knows how difficult it is to win renown in any department of letters. He is particularly fcnppy in his subjects. Mary, Queen of Scots, thd central figure of his first drama, is a person- %e around whom an infinity of beautiful tradi- tions cluster; aud Harold, the hero of his second piece, though calling into play emotions the Jery opposite of those evoked by the misfortunes .r the hapless Mary, has kindled the enthusiasm ftf-ueceeding generations of Englishmen. There Is a fear, howerer, that the play will not be a Success, and the author will have to make another \"B-ty before he wins his spurs as a dramatist. lao lines are as goo3 as TENNYSON'S usually are, Lut the plays will not act. This is said to be their jl; feet. flU SCHOOL BOARD RATE-A. HINT TO LANDLORDS. JjORD CHESIIAM, who is a great authority amongst fcrricul-.urists, has earned a right to denounce the School board rate and other burdens which are iiud to fall with such severity upon farmers. His lordship has informed his numerous tenants that fie will assist them in paying the rates for fha current term. One can understand a policy Of this kind, and if those numerous gentlemen, nho are so fond of grumbling about the burdens .1 fanners, would make a little sacrifice to lessen -Viose burdens, their sincerity would be more parent than it i*. r As a rule, however, they Endeavour to assist their tenants out of the public \u2022xchequer which increases the value of their own 'fond, and in the meantime they Beize every Opportunity of raiaing rents. Lord CHESHAM has tut an example which, we fear, few will follow. MECHANICS* INSTITUTES. tfR. FORSTEK, in his speech delivered at Halifax, tave a sjood hint to mechanics' institutions when e said that it was not their business to impart elementary education. Elementary schools are Jfeirnerous enough what, therefore, is required for mechanics and the working classes generally fff.i schools for advanoed subjects, that is to say, targets not impartod to lads in primary schools. W.tit advantages such as these the course of in- struction need never cease, but the workman oould pursue a series of well-graduated studies which voul 1 enable him to vie with competitors in almost ftoy class of life. A HEROINE. .c M :s PEAKE, wife of the Rev G. PEAKE. curate in chargeof St John's parish, Chatham, caught small- while visiting the sick and died on Monday. ka deceased lady had only heen married about eighteen months.' This is the brief record of an action in every respect as courageous as that of the soldier who rashes into the imminent deadly breach. If Mrs PEAKE had been a. man, and }i d slaughtered various fellow creatures, she h >nU have had the Victoria Cross but being a V\"man she would, had she happily escaped the iernble disease whoso dangers she braved, not have received even the thanks of her country. Her sad story will, however, causo a thrill of emotion in the bosom of everyone who reads it. Jiobody knows how much we owe to poor curate s fold their devoted wives. fROFES.SOR HUXLEY AND THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY. fpjiOERssoR HCXLEY has resumed his old, defiant attitude. H:3 lateat speech is enough to set all the churches in opposition to him, which is the knore to be deplored, as he speaks in his capacity as a public teacher of Biology. In Qpening the lejture at South Kensington, on Saturday, he .|laid that animals were to be regarded as minor Inodifications of one great fundamental unity, and ili it from man as the summit, they were Idl by many roads, step by step, and gradation by gradation, to a speck of animated jelly; eo again with botany, there was a Eaat scale of being, with series and gradations, from e most complicated form of vegetable life to the Simplest, coming down to a simple speck of .nimated jelly, with nothing to distinguish t from the sgpek reached by the uumal He regarded study vs useful when it overgilt idea\", from which right actions might spring. The world is governed by ideas, and it is important ideas should, be as far as possible removed from error. Biology gave us important teaching regarding man's place in nature, corrected the old nodons about his recent origin, showed how in structure and function he was like other animals, and removed the idea that he was the all important central feature in the universe. It further, in \u2022matters of fact,, taught us much that was valuable in regard to the germ theory of disease, and among many o'her cases that might be cited it put an en- tirely new aspect on agricultural operations.\" If these ideas are right, the old ones are all wrong, but it will take some time to make a good many people believe it. THE EXPLOSION AT ADERTILLERY. COLLIERY managers, mine owners, and all.who have the oversight of underground coal workings, are startled by the calamity which occurred at Abertiliery on Monday last, and feel called upon to investigate more closely the coincidence of a faH in the barometer with the development of gas in the pits, and a consequent liability to explo- sion. As has already been pointed out, the Llan Colliery explosion of 12 months ago took place at a time when the atmospheric pressure was identical with that of the past week, and more than one newspaper recently gave warning to colliers when the dass began to go down, bidding them be careful to guard against explosions. Jt ap- pears that the South Wales pit, near Abertiliery, was worked with naked lights, so strong was the feeling with regard to the safety of the ventila- tion but colliers are apt, by their carelessness and familiarity with danger, to neutra ize the efforts of those in authority, and only when too late do they see and lament their folly, la the case under consideration the most remarkable thing is the great loss of life with the small loss of property, circumstances which are generally re- versed. It is well that the explosion occurred on Monday morning, for on any other morning there would have been far more men in that particular heading, and a greater loss of life would doubtless have followed, THE WHITCHURCH MURDER CASE. THERE was evidently a general feeling of satisfac- tion in this neighbourhood when it became known that a commutation of sentence had been granted to the unfortunate young girl who was con- demned to death last week at Swansea. e sty unfortunate; for though the crime of murder generally meets with the execration of mankind, and the murderer has few to pity him yet in the case of MARY PETERSON MAIIONEY, the circum- stances are such as to have excited the commisera- tion of all in whose bosoms the milk of human kindness has not been turned to gall. An orphan, and subject to epileptic nts what more probable than the theory that at the moment when that child of sin and shame first saw the light its un- happy mother should have been so bereft for the time of her ordinary reasoning powers as to imagine that the babe stood between her and her daily bread, her reputation, yea. her very exist- ence. That some such view as this must have in- fluenced the public of Cardiff and the neighbour, hood is evident from the readiness with which the petition for a reprieve was signed. Magistrates, guardians, councillors, and men and women of all classes united in the merciful act. The name of the poor girl's seducer is now published, and we would not for a thousand worlds be the prey to the feelings which must harrow the bosom of that man, if, indeed, the crime of seduction can be perpetrated by anyone who has any feeling, and whose conscience is not seared as with a hot iron. AMFUSING CHARGE OF THEFT. WHEN the young man BENJAMIN THOMAS, of Pandy, profferred to carry home the market basket of one whom we are bound to consider as a hand- some young lady, he had doubtless no idea that his kindness would land him in the police court, arraigned as a thief. BENJAMIN neglected to name his price for his services beforehand, and so when they arrived at the home of the fair one, and he wanted a kiss for his pay, the maiden refused to let him have it, and after an alterca- tion, rather than undergo the osculatory process, she left the basket with him, and went in-doors. What became of the basket our reporter does not say, but BENJAMIN will no doubt make a provious bargain with the next charming young lady whose basket he wishes to carry, and make sure of h:8 kiss, minus the disagreeable police court proceedings. THE SHOCKING DEATH OF A TELEGRAPH BOY. THE awful death of the telegraph message boy MALONEY on Saturday at Cardiff, will, it is hoped, prove a salutary check to the temerity of the body of which he was a member. We have repeatedly noticed the audacity with which these boys will cross the streets in front of passing vehicles, putting one in mind of the railway servants who take a pride in showing how they can cross the rails when a train is cominc in. The situation of'the office in which MALONEY was employed, so very close to a line of rails, was a very dangerous one, and ought to have made him doubly cautious in leaving it; but boys are apt to grow careless in such matters, in spite of the warnings of their elders.",

                "full_text": "SCIENCE NOTES & NEWS. EFFECTS OF COLD ON SEEDS. Some important experiments on the effect of cold on seeds are described by Mr. J. Adams in the Scientific Proceedings of the Royal Society of Dublin. The seeds experimented upon were peas, barley, flax, swede, red clover, mea- dow fescue, and timothy grass. It was found that 65 to 96 per cent. of dry seeds germinated after twenty-four hours' immersion in liquid air. Moist seeds, after a similar immersion, utterly failed to grow. It is suggested as an explana- tion that in the latter case the formation of ice crystals in the seed ruptures the tissues, and thus causes the death of the protoplasm, INSECTS AND PAIN. The following remarkable observation of the great naturalist Fabre seems to indicate that insects are not very sensitive to pain. A species of solitary wasp stores up the bodies of hive bees to nourish its larvae. It catches the bee on the flower, and if it finds its captive full of honey, squeezes out the sweet liquid, and drinks it before storing up the body for its young. This bee-catching wasp, however, sometimes falls a prey to another insect, the mantis. Now. on one occasion, Fabre saw a wasp which had just seized a bee, and was squeezing out the honey, itself seized and held fast in the saw-like fore- legs of a mantis. And as the latter held the wasp transfixed, and was gnawing its under- parts, the wasp went on licking up the honey squeezed from the bee! LOWEST TEMPERATURE KNOWN. I-n the northern hemisphere the greatest cold seems to have been observed at Werchojansk, in Siberia, where it is stated that the thermometer goes down as low as -.69'8 deg. C. However, according to the information which has been brougiit by the Russian artist Borrissoff, certain parts of Nova Zembla seem to shew at least as low a temperature as the above. The Bulletin of the Societe Astronomique states that in an excursion which M. Borrissoff made in the Strait of Matotchkin. he discovered underneath a case a box containing two thermometers, one a maximum and the other a minimum-recording thermometer. It is supposed that these instru- ments belonged to Heifer, an Austrian geologist, who made an expedition to this spot in 1872. One of the thermometers was found to have registered the temperature of +15 as a maxi- mum, while the second instrument shewed that the greatest cold had been \u201470deg. C. This value seems to be the extreme cold which has been reached in this region for thirty years pasti VALUE OF MICRO-BIOLOGY. The bacteria and other microscopic forms of plant and animal life, all of which are conveni- ently included under the term microbes, have so lately begun to be understood and appreciated, remarks the Scientific American, that we must still emphasise their extreme importance. The discoveries of the botanists and zoologists and revelations of the microscopists in this domain are comparable, in their importance to public health science, with nothing less than the reve- lations of the telescope to astronomy. Astro- nomy had indeed existed long before the inven- tion of the telescope, and public health science had its beginnings nearly a century before any considerable progress had been made in micro- biology. But it is not too much to say that the developments in micro-biology since Pa.stcur began his work have not only revolutionised our ideas of the nature of the infectious diseases, but have also placed in our hands the key of their ComDlete control. FLIGHT OF THE lI.Ylv; FISH. Does the flying fish really fly, or is the so- called flight a mere extended leap, in which the fins are used on the principle of the aeroplane to float or rest on the air, and so afford support to the body? The question has been much discussed, and many naturalists have denied it the power of true flight. Mr. Frank Bullen. who, in his many voyages, has had unique opportunities for observing the Byino, fish, is emphatic in the asser- tion that it does really fly in the proper sense of the word. He has seen it, for example, change its course at a sharp angle when a.n obstacle in- tervened, and when about to re-enter the water he has seen it rise and continue its course on see- ing an enemy below. Some observations contri- buted by Lieutenant-Colonel Durnford to the \"Annals and Magazine of Natural History\" confirm this view. The writer contends that the ordinary aeroplane theory involves a mechanical ordinary aeroplane theory involves a mechanical impossibility. The true explanation is an in- tensely rapid vibration of the wing-like fins\u2014a vibration which becomes apparent to the eye as it slows down when the fish reaches the water. THE CYCLE OF METON. There is a period, latiown as the Cycle of Meton, says The Story of the Sun,\" which plays a very important part in the several re- lations between the sun and the moon. It can be shewn that the exact length of 235 lunations is 6,939*69 days. It also appears, by simple mul- tiplication. that nineteen years, reckoned each at 365-25 days. amount to 6,939*75 days. As the former of these periods is only about an hour and a-half shorter than the latter, we arc justi- fied in saying that nineteen years is almost exactly equal to 235 lunations. From the al- manack-maker's point of view the Cycle of Meton has a distinct importance. It tells him that in nineteen years from any date the moon will have made a number of complete revolutions around the sun, and therefore the age of the moon, en any particular day of the year, will be repro- duced on that day nineteen years, or, more pre- cisely, after an interval of 6,939'6 days. Thus, for instance, on the day that these lines are being penned\u2014that is, on March 28th. 1393- the moon is ten days old. If we r r back 6,939*6 days we come to March 28th. 1 71. In this interval the exact number of 235 lunations have been performed. The age of the moon will therefore have been the same as on the same day of the year nineteen years later. INSECT PESTS AND THEIR ENEMIES The protection of fruit trees from their insect enemies has been in recent years practised on scientific lines in the Hawaiian Islands and Cali- fornia. Lady birds imposed from Australia and New Zealand proved efficient in destroying the aphides and scale inspcts which were ruining the fruit crops. Mr. Compere, who is continuing this work for California, holds the view that every insect pest has its destroyer by which it might be kept in che- k. This has led to investi- gations in various parts of the world with the view of finding the natural de>< rovers of porticu- lar pests. The codling-moth, for example. bad dono muc.J\u00a1 damage to the Californium apple trees, and in the course of ins travels Mr. Com- pere found a district in Spain where the codling- moth occurred, and yet did only slight damage. Examination shewed that it was kept in check'by an ichneumon-fly. Pupas of this flv were, there- fore, obtained and sent over to California. They were allowed to hatch out on the infected trees, and they at. once set to work on the caterpillars. The method sometimes adopted to introduce the desirable alien is to send a young infected tree to the country where the enemy has been dis- covered. It returns with a stock of the de- stroyer. THE HISTORY OF HELIUM. Helium, the supposed pivduct of the disinte- gration of the atoms of radium, has had an inte- resting history, says a Olobc writer. Its existence was first made known by the appearance of cer- tain new lines in the solar spectrum. As these lines did not correspond to those of any known substance, the presence of a new element in the sun was inferred, and it was appropriately named Helium. And after having been known as a solar element only for some twenty-five vears. helium was found pn earth as the constituent of a rare mineral. It is now known as a rare but rather widely-diffused terrestrial element. iteiium is a gas, and it ESCAPES INTO THE ATMOSPHERE from a number of mineral springs. Yet helium is not a constituent of the atmosphere. In a similar way the considerable quantities of hydro- gen which escape into the air can scarcely be de- tected. It was these facts which led Dr. John- stone Stoney to his remarkable theory that these gases escape from the earth's atmosphere into outer space. Rising by their lightness to the upper layers, the velocity of the path of their atoms is so great that they are able to escape the control of gravity, and wander off through solar or steIJar space until attracted by some larger body. Thus, particles of helium and hydrogen from the earth may finally reach the sun, The helium whose",

Dr. James is ah evidence of the indomitable pluck and energy of a student who has, as Principal Roberta, of Aberystwyth, states, marked out for himself an extended plan of preparation, and steadfastly pursued it.\" He was born in Plasdoylan, in Conwil Elvet, Car- marthenshire, 31 years ago. After the usual course of elementary education he began the battle of life when twelve years of age, as a grocer's apprentice. in which capacity he served in Merthyr and Treorky. But after two years he returned to hie first love, and at the age of sixteen, having won a three years' exhibition, he entered the Cardiff University College from the Tetrad Higher Grade 8ebool, and there he was brought under the powerful influence of the late Principal Viriamu Jones, j Professor Koberts, and others. At the end of the third year he entered the normal depart- ment for two years. While at Cardiff he passed the London University Matriculation Examination in 1889, inter arta in 1890, and final B.A. in 1892; he was senior prizeman in mathematics in 1891, and prizeman in physical and commercial geography in 1892, he was placed in the first class in both years on the certificate list, and on the college sessional list he took a first class for theoretical and practical teaching. In mathematics he passed in the seven stages of the Science and Art Department before leaving college. Ile 'aloo passed in theoretical mechanics, honours; stage, in 1893. From October, 1892, to July, 1893, he attended, at Cardiff, the intermediate course of lectures, and performed laboratory work in physics, concurrently with studying higher mathema- tics. During the session 1893-4 Ile worked at practical biology and practical chemistry (each for six hours per week) in the Cardiff laboratories. From 1893 to 1896 he served as an assistant-master at the Rhondda Pupil Teachers' Centre, where he gained valuable experience in teaching, as well as in draw- ing up schemes of study in various subjects. He returned to Cardiff, and from there entered Balliol College, Oxford, as exhibi- tioner (open examination in mathematics), January, 1896; obtained the Goldsmiths' Exhi- bition, tenable for four years, within six months; passed moderations, first class, honours (mathematics) in 1896; final schools, second class, honours in 1899; studied advanced physics at Oxford from 1898 to 1900. Not content with reaching the top of the British educational ladder, he went over to Germany, and entered the University of Erlangen in October, 1900, and for over two years attended a course in experimental physics, mineralogy, and mathematics. In 1902 he obtained the B-Se. research degree (only awarded when a high standard of merit has been attained) at Oxford, November, 1902 He obtained the Ph.D. degree (Magna Cum Lauda) at Erlangen, December. 1902.

Lord Aberdare presided, and there were also presentThe Revs W. Bruce and D. Evans (Wnitchurch), Dr Edwards, the Principal (Mr J. V. Jones), Professor Ker, Mr A. Thomas, M.P., Messrs G. C. Thompson and Ivor James (tegistrar). The report of the principal for the past session was read, stating that the session commenced on October 6th, 1885. The results of the examinations for entrance scholarships and exhibitions and of the annual exhibition (which in br.th cases have already been published) were g-ven, and the report added that the total number of day students during the session had k, lb5. Of these 27 tipd attended one course, 14 two courses, and 124 three or more courses of lie lures. There was an licrc\".c of 15 in the total number of students as compared with last session, and an increase of seven in the number of students taking three or more courses of lectures. 107 of the 124 students attending three or more courses of lectures were men studantm-jku increase of four as compared with last session. The 41 attending one or two courses only came, as might be expected, from Cardiff and its immediate neighbourhood. There is a considerable increase in the senior classes, but they were still much smaller than the Ilninr, and would, he feared, remain so for some time to eome. Only the n-tter men from the junior classes would succeed in making such pro- press as would render it possible for them to attend the senior classes with advantage and take the London degree. The standard of the London examinations was at the present time too high for the average Welsh student, who could not, as a rule, simultaneously gral\" With so many sub- jects as were demanded at the London matricula. tion examination. The remedy lay in two directions. First,in tn entrance examination); and, secondly, in thn establishment of alternative curri- cula in which fewer subjects shall ba taken than are ,required in the London examinations. The report of the executive committee of the Aberdare Hall was most encouraging, and would, he hoped, lead the council to take the further step of providing a hall of residence for men students. Even if they admitted that such a hall would be an experiment, it was one which wa\" of high importance to make, with a view of lea., whether such a residential system was not more consonant; with the feelings and circumstances of the people of South Wales than the present system of lodging-houses. The ad vantage of the latter system was that it enabled the student to adjust his mode of living to his means to a sreater extent than was possible in the former. On the other hand, among the advantages of life at a ball might be mentioned more regular diet, social training, and stricter discipline. He be- lieved that it would be found that both systems would minister to the needs of the population, but it was obvious that residence at a hall would be of special advantage in the case of the younger students.\u2014The reports of the professors were incorporated in the report of the principal, which was adopted. The general purposes committee were in- structed to make preliminary arrangements for the erection at the back of the college premises of lecture rooms fur the professors in physics, chemistry, and in biology. A special vote of tharks was pitted to Mr H. Blackwell, of New York, for an interesting set of monographs on the campaigns of the Civil Wars.",

One of the largest and most complete of modern educational institutions in the North of England, the Yorkshire College, which is situated at Leeds, and was opened by the Prince of Wales in July last, was last evening the scene of consider- able excitement and alarm, in consequence of a fire breaking out in the roof of that portion of the building in which is situated the chemistry lecture hall and the section devoted to the study of biology. It appears that one of the two sunlights with which the chemistry lecture-hall is lighted had been burning the Greater part of the day, and that the heat from this apparatus had set fire to the false flooring which separates the hall from the biological Section above. The discovery was made shortly after nine o'clock, when the fire bad been j Mouldering for some time, but had not ma\u00f9e much progress, owing to the solidity the flooring. The hose connected with establishment was brought into use, but With little effect, and even after the arrival of the Corporation fire brigade but little progress was toade in checking the outbreak, owing to the difficulty of reaching the seat of the fire. At last, however, three jets were brought into play. 4n immense amount of damage was done by the Viater. When the fire was discovered one of the Professors was lecturing to a large audience in the chemistry lecture hall. The lecture was brought to an abrupt conclusion, and though it was feared that a panic might ensue, the large audience left the hall in an ordorly manner. A telegram despatched from Leeds at 8 a.m. this morning states that the fire at the Yorkshire College was got under at one o'clock, and no further outbreak is anticipated. The fire is believed to have originated in a sunlight in the chemical lecture hall, where a lecture was being delivered, aud was communicated to the biological lecture-room above. The damage, chiefly caused by water, will be covered by insurance, but the inconvenience and loss of time caused to students will be very considerable. The firemen are still keeping watch over the building.

The other day Lord Milner, the Tory army-aristocrat, declared that \"much of the misery of the civilised worrld could be attributed to de- fective organisation,\" with rnuny of the suggested re-meditli for wh.i(;h he ex- pressed himself in agreement, notwith- standing that their tendency was to- wards Socialism.\" This- statement was provoked by a remarkable) paper read be- fore the Royal Society of Arts by Mr. C. R. Enock, C.E., a paper which is now reproduced at length in the \"Journal\" It treated of the \"N eeed for Industrial Resources.\" The writer started from the proposition that \"the conditions of economic strife and poverty (in the world) would be comprehensible if we were living upon a moribund planet, whose resources were disappear- ing, but the earth's resources are much more than capable of supporting its whole population in plenty. \"What we require,\" he said, \"is a real science of 'living upon the earth,' or 'human geography.' All other sciences are highly developed. We anialyse the elements and survey the remotest star, but we h&ve not yet learned to live upon a touiitiful earth in economic peace. A constructive economic biology of this character would have something of a net outlook on the world, regard- ing it as a vast property calling for effi- cient d evelop mervfc. The planb are worked out in consider- able detail in the paper which is full of suggestive ideas for Socialists, though they may not. follow Mr. Enock in all parti culars. I THE SMALL TOWN FOR THE COUNTRYSIDE. Mr. Enock argues that the keynote of national stabilIty\" is to be found in the development of local industry and prosperity. \"If all small towM, land oven villages, were able to establish by degrees thoir own workshops and small holdings undier such a principle, the country might perhaps in time be cov- ered with a. mosaic of more ot less self- contained localities literally engaged in 'minding their own business.' \"Such a development might offer considerable advantages for capital, due to the stability of local demand for manu- factured products and foodstuffs, to- gether with stability in labour conditions, also the value of local property should i lie;-ease. \"The dormant possibilities of tho small towns and countryside form a mine 8f unexploit.e.d wealth, but capital hr.s hot yet realised this, nor is there any plafli- ning agency at work. The beauty of the countryside must be preserved. Indus- trial establishments need not be of objec- tionable appearance. They might be of much greatest interest and attraction, and there is great scope for improvement In this resipect, which local industry- piannirg might bring about.\"",

SCIENCE AND ART CLASSES.\u2014A vigorous and success- ful attempt has been made to establish science and art classes in this town in connection with the Government Science and Art Department, South Kensington Museum, London. Mr. Curtis, M.S.A., of the Brynarvor School, Towyn, having intimated his willingness to commence them, it was resolved that prompt advantage be taken of the opportunity. As one essential towards the suc- cess of the undertaking, and as being also a prescribed condition in the Government scheme, a local committee was immediately formed to carry out the necessary arrangements. A public meeting was held on Friday evening, November 10th, in the National School, pre- sided over by Dr. Grosholz, at which were present the Rev. E. O. \"Williams, M.A., incumbent of Aberdovey, Rev, R. E. Morris, B.A. (Calvinistic Methodist), Re-, R. Hopwood (Wesleyan), Colonel Wickham, and a goodly representative number of the inhabitants of the place. The appointed secretary, Mr. Clegg, read a report stating the object of the meeting and the initiatory steps taken to bring it about. The Chairman, in his introductory remarks, spoke of the wonderful facilities opened up in the present day for the spread of knowlellge amongst all classes of the community, and dwelt especially upon the advantages presented in the science and art classes. On the call of the Chairman, Mr Curtis (who had been invited to give an introductory lecture on the proposed work of the classes) addressed the meeting. He entered at some length into the details of the Govern- ment scheme, showing that not only did the Govern- ment aflbrd encouragement by giving scientific instruction at a nominal price, but that it offered prizes of money value to students who were specially successful in their examination. He remarked that some stumbled at the word science, but said that science simply meant knowledge, and clearly showed that knowledge of things around us was attainable by all who were sufficiently interested to put forth the effort. He further introduced ami ably expounded some of the various subjects which; come under the head of science, and specially indicated his intended course of teaching in the\" particular; subjects of study which had been chosen by physio- gmphy a'ld biology. He also stated that in conjunc- tioii W. Thomas, master of the National; ^cnrxj5, Aberdovey, an arrangement had been made for t conduct of a class for (hawing, free hand, model tt geometrical, so that the two departments of science \u2022and art would be represented in the scheme. The usual thanks -were voted to the lecturer and chairman, and the meeting which was remarkable for its aroused and interes.ted attention throughout.. terminated. That there is an evident and general desire to seize the advantages offered in these classes will be seen in the fact that upwards of forty have enrolled themselves as students.",

The audience at the delivery of the President's address, in the Exhibition Palace was very large. At its conclu- sion the Lord Mayor moved a vote of thanks to Mr. Spot- tiswoode. On behalf of the citizens of Dublin he wel- comed the Association, and paid a high tribute to the President. The vote of thanks was seconded by the Pro- vost of Trinity College, and carried by acclamation. On Thursday the Mathematical and Physical Science Section was opened without a formal address, in conse- quence of the absence of the president, Dr. Salmon. There were proceedings in the Geological, the Zoological, tHe Economic Science, and the Geographical Sections. Among the visitors was the Lord Lieutenant, accompanied by the Marquis of Headfort. In the afternoon there was a garden party at the Viceregal Lodge. The leading feature of Friday's business was an intro- ductory address delivered by Professor Huxley, in the Anthropological Department of Biology. He pointed out that twenty-one years ago anthropology was merely a branch of zoology, but now it had become in a measure a distinct science. He denied that it had anything to do with different religious systems, and insisted on the exist- ence of pre-Adamite man. Within the periodhe hadnamed, undoubted proof of this had been found in the shape of fossil remains. His remarks were purely critical, and meant to show the range and method of anthropological science, and the results obtained by it. Saturday was set apart mainly for excursions, ten dif- ferent parties being formed. In the evening a banquet was held at the Mansion House, at which the Duke of Marlborough, Mr. Spottiswoode, President of the Associa- tion, and Lord O'Hagan, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, were present. The Lord Mayor presided. In acknow- ledging the toast of The Lord-Lieutenant and Pros- perity to Ireland,\" the Duke of Marlborough said Ireland was not undeserving of the honour paid to her by the visit of the Association, which afforded her an opportunity of exhibiting that hospitality which had always distin- guished her. His Grace then proceeded to refer to the advances in scientific discoveries made since 1857, when the Association last visited Dublin, and mentioned spe- cially the phonograph and the telephone. The Lord Mayor afterwards gave the toast of The President and Members of the British Association.\" Mr. Spottiswoode, in reply, remarked that it had rarely happened that the Association had assembled in a city so important, amidst a people so hospitable, and in a locality so beautiful. The reports of committees and papers read at the meet- ing of the British Association, on Monday, were unusually numerous. Amongst the subjects that attracted the largest audiences were tho discussions on fire-damp in coal mines, in the mathematical and physical science section Captain Burton's paper on the Land of Midian, and Dr. Phene's paper on the Acquisition of Cyprus by England. At the annual meeting of the Association it was resolved to hold next year's meeting at Sheffield, and the meeting in 1880 atSwansea. Dr. Allinau was elected president of next year's meeting. In Trinity College, on Tuesday, the University degree of LL.D. was conferred, amidst much applause, upon Messrs. Spottiswoode, Williamson, Evans, Huxley, Max- well, Simpson, Flower, J. Thomson, H. J. Smith, Jansen, Sir John Lubbock, Sir C. Wyville Thomson, and Sir Joseph Hooker.",

This Association held its third annual meeting this vear at the Board School, Dolgelley, and, considering the very rough state of the weather, a fair number of teachers were present. The proceedings commenced at 11-30 a.m. In the absence of the chairman and vice- chairman, Mr. Roberts, Board School, Dolgelley, was voted to the chair. The Secretary then read his report for the past half-year, which was adopted and signed. The Chairman afterwards addressed the meeting, andgin a short, pithy speech congratulated the Association upon its success during the past year, notwithstanding the difficulties it had to contend with, not the least among them being the apathy of many of its members, who while sharing the benefits reaped by the body of teachers in general through the representation of \"The National Union,\" failed to contribute what lay in their power towards obtaining them. If it be granted that the U, iii on\" had succeeded in having any of the grievances, of which the teachers justly complained, redressed, then surely it ought to be the duty, not to say the pleasure, of each individual teacher throughout the land to give it his sup- port. In conclusion, Mr. Roberts urged the members to pursue their object, if possible, with double vigour until the just demands of the elementary teacher had been re- cognized and acceded to. He expressed himself highly pleased in being able to propose an addition to the Asso- ciation in the person of Mr. Roberts, Board School, Towvn. Mr. Roberts was formally admitted a member of the Association. The meeting next proceeded to con- sider subject 3 on the agenda. The amalgamation of the Merionethshire and Bala Association, and their formation with the Portmadoc and District Association into a District Union. The proposition met with the unanimous ap. proval of the members, and a motion to that effect was carried. The subscriptions due at this meeting were paid up; and the officers for the ensuing year elected :\u2014Mr. T. J. Lewis, Endowed School, Harlech, to be chairman, and to retain also the secretaryship up to the next meet- ing of the Association in February next; vice-chairman, Mr. Roberts, Dolgelley; treasurer, Mr. Thomas, Bar- mouth. The other business of the Association was post- poned until the next meeting in order to allow Mr. Hughes, Dinas Mawddwy, time to deliver his farewell address to the Association on his leaving it and the pro- fession. The subject of the address was Biology, and it was very admirably and succinctly treated. Before the meeting closed, Mr. Lewis, Harlech, proposed a vote of was very admirably and succinctly treated. Before the meeting closed, Mr. Lewis, Harlech, proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. Hughes for his very able address, and'for his services generally to the Association since its estab- lishment he always having been a most faithful attend- ant at its meetings, having laboured hard for its success, and nevr having missed a single opportunity wherein he could in any way add to its usefulness and progress. The vote was passed with acclamation. The members afterwards sat down to a sumptuous repast prepared for them at the Angel Hotel.",

                "full_text": "ARTISTS AND ARTISANS.-LETTER V. TO THE EDITOR OF THE CAMBRIAN.\" SiR,\u2014I think that we maj\" safely say that the works of Hume, Kant, Turgot, Comlorcet, Buckle, Spencer, Mill and Comte, have been crowned with success, and that human history proceeds according to ascertained laws There is in the Science of History (called Sociology) Lr greater play of awkwa'd pert jrbatiocs than in Astro- u >my. Yet, though human prediction is far more splendidly successful in Astronomy than ever it can be in Sociology, yet we are more than amply consoled by the compensation that the course of Sociological facts is highly amenable to human effort, while the course of Astronomical facts :'s highly unamenable. We cannot lengthen or shorten a day we r yn hasten or lettrd the rise or fall of human institutions, such as Serfdom. Catholicism, Monarchy, Tyranny, Republicanism. Still we do in Socialogy detect hw in spite of perturbation. We d. see the rite of the human intellect through superstitious Theologies to baseless and Fruitless Meta- physics, and thence upward to sound science. We d) see the human intellect constructing the Sciences one after another, bringing them to the positive stage in the order of decreasing generality and increasing complexity first Mathematics, the science of number and extension then astronomy, concerning the Heavenly bodies then Physics, concerning the forces at the earth's surface, altering the states of materials; then Chemistry, dealing only with such changes in the state of matter rs alter the nature of bodies then Biology, which deals only with living bodies, or with those chemical combinations and decompositions which are self-sustaining and self- renewing; then Sociology, which deals with the progress of the great united, continous. self-recording organism, formed by the stream of human generat'ons through ages and ages. We do see the natural succession in Action as well as in thought, namely, the fact that human society goes naturally through the stages of offensive warfare and defensive warfare to Industrialism. We do see that there is a law of evolution of feeling correspond- ing to the laws of intellect and action, namely, that family-feeling under Fetichism broadens into civic feel- ing, under Polytheism, and thence into general bene- volence, uuder Monotheism. We can understand the use of Slavery as following and improving upon the slaughter of captives, its development into serfdom, which develops into free labour, which again will doubt- less develop more and more into Organised Labour. AV, e can in Sociology prophecy with moderate success, and we can also work with moderate success tows-rds or against the fnlfilmentof such prophecies. We must first consider, then imagine, then act. Practically, we are all anxious for human progi-ess,-that is to say, we want something better, which we can get; but we don't know exactly what it is like, nor bow exactly to make for it. The very case for the Artist! He must have a good ground- ing in science and in the practical experience of a varied and daring life then he has a good notion as to the powers of Reformers. Then his artistic powers must come into use, and he must construct with full imagina- tion of detail, of the turns of events, the crabljdness of things, the humbug of hyprocites and turncoats, the quarrels amongst the best-intentioned, the questions of money, the cold-shoulder of a suspicious ajd often- fooled world, and the untamable strength and valour of confident heroes. The hour must be described the man must be described, and also all the preliminary hours and preliminary men. Artists must describe Utopias not Utopias which men cannot reach, but Utopias which they bl can, and probably will.\u2014Yours, &c., C. G. H.",

                "full_text": "WELSH EDUCATION. SUMMER VACATION CLASSES AT ABER- YSTYV YTH. Many laudable and very successful efforts have been made of la:e years to extend the advantages of Univer.-ity education and culture as widely as posdble. One of tbomrst hopeful of such.extensioii movements is the rstabl shmeut of summer vacation classes. Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, and South Kensington have all elone much valuable work of this kind, and it is grat fying to note that the University College of Wales (Aberystwyth) is trying to extend its sphere of useful- ness in the same direction. Successful summer classes were helll there for the first time last year, and arrange- men's are now being made for carrying on similar clashes this year. The exact nature of the work will be gathered from the following quotation taken from the special prospectus In order to meet the requirements of teachers and other (both men and women) whose occupations preclude them from attending the regular College courses during 3-ssion, arrangements have been made for holding 11 el courses of lectures and practical instruction during the three weeks from Monday, August 6th, 1894, to Satur- day, Augu-t 25th, inclusive. The object kept in view in the arrangements has been to offer at the lowest j possible cost a course of study truly educative in subjects and method, though necessarily confined within a very limited period. In order, therefore, to concentrate the instruction as much as possible, the choice of the s u lent is rfstrictcd to one group of sn'jects. By this method it is hoped to combine theoretical and practical instruction, and in that way impart an insight, otherwise impossible, into the principles of the subject selected. The instruction will be suited to the requirements of those who have had no previous traioing in the various sn: j-rC.ts. and will aim at developing the pr ct cal knowledge an-1 ilptitude-as distinguished irom mere book work\u2014which are so essential to those .s ho are called upon to take part in the teaching of othr-rs. It is hardly necessary to point out that the 're.inir demand in schools of all grades for fcit-iitific and t cuoical instruction renders it a matter of the f, os importance that teachers actually engaged I 1,1 toe '.turii of their profession, should have r.ppo.funities of making their teaching in these subjects r. al, stimulating, and attractive. It is with vio f helping to meet this need tkat the vacation oottrse^ h- vc been arranged, and also in the hope of making he lectures, laboratories, library, and museum of th- C beg- more widely useful to the class of earnest j ^toiele-,t? who are debarred from going through a j c'-mplctocousf e of study. The groups are (I) chemistry ami >)'kodrur (2) botany and biology (3) art (4) b >\u25a0ni'i)",

He claims especial notice from this place, where so many of his relatives, the VVredgwoods, were known and honoured. Darwin first attracted public notice through the publication of the charming Voyage of tlte Beagle, which, besides its attractions as a book of travels, enabled everyone to anticipate that its author would do much good scientific work if life was spared. He had the advantage of an ample fortune, which allowed him to concentrate his attention on his chosen pursuits, but the dis- advantage of health so profouuoly bad, that most men would tiav; been utterly prostrated by it and felt themselves justified in idle uselessness. As tar as memory serves, it was about 1857 that Darwin published at the Linnsean Society a short abstract 01 his theory announcing the great prin- ciples of Variation, Survival of the Fittest, and Octavism. The writer of these lines was present, and will never forget the impressions of astonish- ment, horror, and incredulity produced on the majority of the meeting, In i860 the Origin oj Species, which was destined to produce as great a revolution in Biology as Newton's Principia had done in Astronomy, appeared. A storm arose, and Punch and Barsonuoui, little Scientists, and men of \"common sense\" poured out the vials of their ridicule, wrath, and stolidity on the inno- vator. In the twenty years that have passed the Origin of Species has been translated into every b,u, opeaii language, and there is scarcely a man of science who is not mure or less a supporter of Darwin's views. Huxley, Lye.l, iicickel, Lubbock, Virchow, all gave in adherence, more or less com- plete, to his principles, and probably such a revo- lution was neyer before accomplisned in so short a period, ihe Origin of Species was followed at various periods by the Descent of Man, the Fer- tiiisuiiou of Orchids, the Ejfects of Domestication on Man ana Animals, the Expression of the Emotions, and finally, and very recently, uy the most remark- aole book Oil Earth Worms and their Work in Nature. And each of these books would have founded the fame of an ordinary man It makes one giddy to contemplate the enormous labour which that giant intellect forced the feeble frame in which it dwelt to accomplish. Perhaps the rarest and most beautiful trait in Darwin's character was his perfect fairness vVhether you agreed with him or not you never tailed to recognise that you were in the presence of a man wnose single aim was Truth. tie was always ready to acknowledge, yes even to indicate, detective links in his chain of arguments, and as ready to modify or withdraw conclusions pushed farther than his premisses would justify, and to give the fullest consideration to all objections of the humbltst opponent. He never contended for victory apart from Truth, and his mind was so constituted that he would have welcomed any theory* however much opposed to his own, if it would have brought him nearer the object of his life-long search. tie lived and died Charles Darwin, M.A. It is not the fashion in England to bestow outward distinctions on her greatest men. Newton was a Knight, Mr Baring was made Lord Ashburnham. Darwin would have conferred splendour on the highest rank, but tue highest rank could lend no giory to him. F. D. D. 9-",

L.C.C. and Robert A. Dawson, superintend- ent of the Lancashire and Western Sea, Fish- eries district. Published in London. 32. Fleet-street; and Liverpool, 45 to 51. South Castle-street; and all booksellers, price five shillings net. The Clerks to the Joint Com- mittee are J. P- Muspratt, Esq., B.A., and Randal Casson, Esq.] (By William Hampson. Whittingham, Preston.) Sympathisers with the fishermen of England and Wales have now on their agenda the tech- nical education problem which has had an initial trial, and promises favourably. In Lancashire, selections from the better sort of fishermen re- cently had a fortnight's training in the hatcher- ies and museums in the northern part of the district, at the expense of the County Council, with promising results. Under the Act of 1890. grants for the development .of technical educa- tion of all classes are made to the Councils of administrative counties and county boroughs, and the same are disbursed by sub-committees of such Councils, which in some cases consist en- I tirely of Council members, and, sometimes, out- siders. It is suggested that Councils in counties within the district of the L. and W. S. F. Joint Committee, other than Lancashire, should avail themselves of the Government aid. for the bene- fit of deserving working fishermen students. The good work done hy Welsh fishing industry provides ample assurance that many worthy can- didates will be found, desirous of receiving the benefit of instruction, and after the tests have been found practical their popularity will in- crease, and sfmilar classes be established through- out the domain of the Joint Committee. It is by the agency of these enlightened measures that the status of the British sea toiler must be improved, and more amicable relations estab- lished between the fishermen and those repre- senting the law. That there is room for a bet- terment of this nature is proved in many ways, amongst which we mav instance the following, viz:\u2014A Heysham fisherman, signing himself \"T. Parkinson,\" has a letter in the last issue of the \"Lancashire Observer and Morecambe Chronicle, which eventually may prove an- other illustration of the fact that \"g-ood may accrue from evil. The contribution in ques- tion exhibits a spirit of prejudice, and expresses somewhat bitterly his antagonism to the \"modus operandi\" of the executive of the Joint Commit- tee. whom he charges with encroaching on the freedom of the poor fishermen and their means of obtaining a living. He says that many of their proceedings are tantamount to striking the craftsmen \"below the belt.\" He also ridicule's their suggestions, doubts their experi- ence, the authenticity of their statements, and scoffs at their claims to practical knowledge. Briefly, he does not think they are the fisher- men's friends or supporters. This is the evil side of his letter, denuded of much personal badinage and rudeness. We thank him sincerely for his epistle, as it enables us to pufyjjih. an array of facts in proof of the inaccuracy of Mr Parkinson's statements, which will not only confute his assertions, but convince manv en- gaged- in this industry that the lo-entlemen* com- prising the executive of the Joint Board (also their officers) have only the good of society at heart, without fee or reward for their services or prominence beyond that accorded public work- I ers. Many sea toilers who have in the past shared with Mr Parkinson these doubts, may now peruse the other side of the question and allarr such doubts for ever. Mr Parkinson's ideas are strangely chimerical. We will prove this by strict adherence to literalness in our quotations, and utterly annihilate such state- ments. In the Memoir II., page 70 (Messrs H. and D.), we have the following, viz. \u2014",

                "full_text": "DEATH OF MR. HERBERT SPENCER. We regret to announce the death of Mr. Herbert Spencer, which took place on Tuesday at Brighton, after an illness of some duration. He was in his eighty-fourth year. Herbert Spencer was one of the few of the world's great figures in whom, alike by hereditary predis- position and by environment, the child foreshadowed the man. The son of a Derbyshire schoolmaster, who was also, in his way, given to philosophic studies, and was a man of some attainments in entomology, the boy himself developed an early aptitude in this amiable walk of the minor sciences. From linguistic studies he had an aversion so deep- seated that a University training, which had been the father's ambition, was seen to be out of the question, and at seventeen the future protagonist of philosophy based frankly upon Evolution found himself indentured to a railway engineer destined to eminence\u2014Mr. (afterwards Sir) Charles Fox. Even at this early age, however, abstract science had marked Spencer for its own, though he attained, while still in his teens, to a proficiency which ensured him admission as a contributor to the professional journals. His first appearance before the public as a thinker was at the age of twenty-two, when he published in the Nonconformist a, series of letters on \"The Proper Sphere of Government,\" which made such an impression that a year later they were published in pamphlet form. Philosophy had HOW asserted its undisputed mastery. For engineering and its utilitarian problems he became steadily more dis- inclined, and at twenty-eight abandoned them for the realm of pure science, which he entered by that humble wicket door of journalism which has served as an avenue to so many diversified spheres of eminence. He became sub-editor of the Economist, and two years later, in 1850, his first important work saw the light. This was \"Social Statics,\" which was followed in rapid succession during the fifties and sixties by that series of writings, masterly in their wide grasp of science under many aspects, and brilliant in their power of generalised illustra- tion, which stamp Spencer as one of the strongest intellects of the nineteenth century. Biology, psychology, social forces, political institutions, and principles of ethics all came under his review, and indicate how, in his strictly logical and deductive habits of thought, the whole problem and mystery of life was surveyed from its crudest germs to the highest and most complete develop- ments. Among British men of science, Spencer may almost be described as, far excellence, a master, while the regard in which he was held abroad may be inferred from the fact that he was strongly commended as worthy of the Nobel Prize for literature. Academic honours, of which many were offered to him, Mr. Spencer always declined on principle. Since 1886 he has been a chronic invalid.",

                "full_text": "CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY. At a congregation, held at Cambridge on Tuesday the University conferred the honorary degree of LL D on a number of men distinguished in learn- ing poetry, science, and literature. The Senate House was filled with an influential audience, amongst whom were doctors of various faculties in scarlet robes. The doctors designate were intro- duced to the Vice-Chancellor by the Public Orator, Mr. Sandys, M.A., St. John's, in a Latin speech, in which their special characteristics entitling them to recognition by the University were descanted upon. Each was heartily applauded on being introduced to the Vice-Chancellor. The new doctors were Mr. Justice Grove, Sir Frederick Leighton, President of the Royal Academy; Mr. Robert Browning, the poet; Mr. William Stubbs, Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford; Mr. W. Spottiswoode, President of the Royal Society Mr. Henry J. S. Smith, F.R.S., Savillian Professor of Geometry at Oxford; Mr. T. H, Huxlev, F,RS., Professor of Natural His- tory in the \"Royal School of Mines; Mr. H. C. Sorby, F.R.S., President of the Geological Society; Mr. B: A. Bond, Principal Librarian, and Mr. C. T. Newton, Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiqui- ties in the British Museum. The PUBLIC OraTOR spoke of Justice Grove as following tbe example of Lord Bacon in his devo- tion to science and the attainment of eminence in the law; alluded to Sir Frederick Leighton's pro- found sense of the majesty and dignity of art by avoiding the common-place and living only in the loftier regions. His great powers as a sculptor were also alluded to. Mr. Brown- ing's deep knowledge of -human nature, intellec- tual subtlety, and power-of phsycological analysis, and his devotion to dramatic, as well as lyric poesy, were referred to. Processor Stubbs was spoken of as, though an Oxonian, worthy of a Cambridge doctor's robe, alike worthy to succeed Freeman, as Fellow of Trinity College. Oxford, and Dr. Lightfoot, as Canon of St Paul's. Mr. Spottis- woode's admiration for mathematics, his wide attainments in philosophy, and his acquired knowledge of Indian mathematics and of Sans- krit. His travels were referred to, and Professor Smith's high attainments in the ancient languages and in mathematics rendered him a worthy occu- pant of the -chair of geouietry. Professor Huxley was .adverted to in connection with his special 'domain of biology, his voyage 1in the Rattlesnake, his important contri- bution to the study of fossils and geology, his attention to metaphysics, as well as to natural science, aud'concluded by referring to his ideal of a. liberal Eden, namely, to hate all vileness and to love all beauty, whether of nature or art. Mr. Sorby was one of the first Englishmen to apply the microscope to the investigation of the structure and ph) sical properties of minerals and meteorites, as President of the Geological Society. He had I crowned the work of 30 years by delivering an 1 address at the comnsemcemeat of the present year, which was a truly valuable monument of I his fame. Messrs. Bondaud Newton's fame, I earned in connection with the British Museum, were also adverted to. At the end of the ceremony, Browning And Leighton were singled out by undergraduates and cheered, as also were the Public Orator,- Beaconsfield, Gladstone, the \\ice-Chancellor, and the ladies*",

                "full_text": "MONMOUTH. A very elegant and characteristic composition, entitled The Mountain Stream,\" likely to become deservedly popular, has just proceeded from the pen of Mr. Sydney Smith, the eminent Crystal Palace pianist, (whose recitals there are immensely successful,) and which, in appreciation of her musical talents, he has dedicated to Miss Bessie M. Waugh, of Monmouth. THE UNITED KINGDOM TELEGRAPH COMPANY (LIMITED.)\u2014Application was made on Tuesday last, to the trustees of the Huntley, Mitcheldean, and Elton districts of turnpike roads, by the company's repre- sentative, Mr. Tribe, for permission to erect the poles and wiies along the roads. Mr. J. B. Saunders, (the superintendent of the Electric and International Telegraph Company, whose wires are already erected on the South Wales lines, and who have a most extensive and admi- rable system), accompanied by Mr. E. W. Coren, solicitor, of Gloucester, opposed the application, on tbe grounds that the new company were not possessed of parliamentary powers, that the shilling tariff was unre- munerative and could not possibly last, moreover that the trustees had no*^|gal power to grant the permission asked lor they also \"pointed out the great danger likely to arise owing to thm breakage of wires, & which would cause most serious accidents in the dark to travellers passing along the highway. The matter was very fully discussed, and the Trustees ulti- mately resolved to refuse their consent. We hear that a similar application was made at Tewkesbury, in which latter place permission had already been granted, but on the representation of the Electric and International Telegraph Company's agent it was withdrawn, so that for the present there seems to be no possibility of having a rival telegraph company in this district. ENTERTAINMENT.\u2014According to previous announce- ment, entertainments have been given in Mesmerism and Electro Biology, by Mr. H. Stevens, in the Borough Court. I Tows Couxcil.. An adjourned meeting of thisr Board was held on Wednesday last, fur the purpose of I transacting the business of the corporation. Samples of cloth for the police clothing were produced by the con. tractor, and approved of, and after disposing of some other unimportant matters, the meeting separated. ANNUAL BALL.\u2014On Monday last, the usual annual hall took place at the Ropemaker's Arms, Monnow- street. Upwards of a hundred attended, the greater porlion of the visitors availing themselves of the opportunity of joining in the dance. About two o'clock, the company sat down to a very capital spread, provided by the host and hostess, Mr. and Mrs. Nelson Williams who, it is but fair to state, strained every nerve to render their guests comfortable. After the removal of the cloth, dancing was resumed, and was kept up with unabated vigour till early morn. The spacious ball- room was very tastefully ornamented for the occasion, and the arrangements generally were carried out in a very creditable manner; MONMOUTH FAIR\u2014This fair took place on Wednesday last, but the stock exhibited was very scanty. Fat beasts 6d. to 651. per lb., sheep, 7d. ditto. Pigs very dear. Of horses there was a good supply, and good carters and useful saddle horses realised high rates. The fair, altogether, was by no means a large one, either as re \u00a3 ,rds attendance of purchasers, or stock. MOSJIOCTII ATlIEX\u00c6UL- \\V e understand that the Indy patronesses of the forthcoming fancy fair, or bazaar, to be held for the bent-fie of this excellent institution, are using their best exertions for the good of the cause, and we earnestly hope that their noble example will be followed generally by our female, friends. We have little doubt as regards the success of any undertaking when taken in hand by the fair sex and if, as we augur, this succeeds, we opine that the Monmouth Literary Institute wi11 be on a firmer footing than ever.",

MORMONISM.\u2014A little excitement has been caused here, in consequence of a discussion on Mormonism having been announced to take place at the Beaufort Arms Inn. The orators were an M.D named Cook) aad Mr. Thomas, a pro eS8\u00b0r P T electro-biology, and many other ologies a \u2022 J. Thomas, a Mormonist preacher. Our curio y ong others, to the scene of the wordy war, hoping to gam a little information from the learned dispu- tation; put. lo! a,nd behold, instead of fair arguments, we i TKii- q(,L 1Sed to hear nothing but inflated rhapsodies, \u2022, 6 P(^r.30nalitie3 from one, and a pretty share of qUId pro quo from hIs opponent. However, we must candidly say, that of the two disputants, the latter had the more redeeming quabtics. Mormonism is a subject we should like to hear fairly discussed, and see its fallacies logically exploded, but we must say that the Dr.'s rhetoric and reasoning powers, were very far from up to the mark. LATTER-DAY SAINTS.\u2014A lecture was delivered on Friday evening last, in the Primitive Methodist Chapel, Brynmawr, by Mr. John Ricks, local preacher\" On the absurdity and falsehood of the Monnon system.\" The lecturer,\" in a very able manner, proved that miracles were at an end when thi last of P jdied, and that they were only practised by our Saviour and his apostles, to prove that Christ was the Messiah. Mr. RIcks, at the conclusion of his lecture, stated that the Mormons, before a committee which had been formed for the purpose oimaking araangements for a public discus- sion on their doctrines, had rejected the proposals for such discussion. Tie was listened to hv a large concourse of people, who, on occasions, expressed their approval of the lecture by loud applause. WANTON MISCHIEF.\u2014On Monday night last, some mali- ciously-disposed person threw a stone, and broke the glass of the lamp over the door of Mr. Wilham Ford, grocer. This is the third time the glass has been broken. Some persons sup- pose it is done for a lark, but we trust the police will be able to bring the night larkers to justice. Mr. Ford has offered a reward to any person who will givt information against them. VENTRILOQUISM.\u2014We are happy to state that the celebrated Professor Ewart has succeeded in^ securing the Town Hall for hi# entertainments, which are to take place during the pay.\" BUILDING SOCIETIES.\u2014Mr. Robert Parry (Rohin Ddu)* delivered a lecture at the Town Hall, on Monday evening last, on the advantages arising from liuilding Societies, to the middle and lower classes; and on luesday evening, in the long room of the Greyhound, Nantyglo, he delivered a similar lecture. Mr. Parry was listened to with much attention by some hundreds of persons. LECTURE.\u2014On Wednesday the Rev. J. Phillips, of Bangor, delivered a lecture in Rehoboth Chapel, Brynmawr, On tho Connexion of the Prophecies with the Government of Great. Britain.\" The large chapel was crowded to excess. The proceeds were appropriated to the liquidating of the debt remaining on Libanus Mothodiot Chapel, Brynmawr. A man named Da vies was committed for trial at the next Breeonshire quarter sessions, on a charge of stealing a turning saw, the property of Mr. William Jones, cabinet maker. \u2014Bail was accepted for his appearance at the sessions. \u00bb",

Dyke-Acland, M P (Vice President of the Council), who was ac- companied by Major-General Sir John Donnelly, at the offices of the Science and Art Department, South Kensington, on the subject of the new rules for organistd science schools. The deputation consisted of the president of the association Mr. A. Scott (South Shields Higher Grade School), Mr. John Bidgood (Gateshead Higher Grade School), Dr Forsyth (Central Higher Grade School, Leeds), the Rev. George Towner (Car- penters' Company's Institute, Stratford), Mr. W. G. Constable (Derby Higher Grade School), and the secretary, Mr. W. Dyche. The deputation was the outcome of a very large and representative meeting of the association, held at Derby, on Feb- ruarv 23, to consider the new rules for organised science schools lately issued by the Department The importance of the new regulations lies in the fact that under them will be inaugurated and carried on a svstem of secondary schools under the control of, and supported to a great extent by, the Science and Art Department. The organised science schools at present in existence include nearly all the more important higher grade schools, the day schools of technical institutions, and a considerable number of grammar schools. 1 he principal changes proposed in the new rules are the partial substitution of inspection for examination, the introduction of special courses of instruction for women students, the inclusion of a fair proportion of literary work in the curriculum, and the addition to it of practical work in physics and biology. The principal modifications suggested by the deputation were (1) That students should be allowed to enter the schools at a somewhat earlier age than is now proposed (2) that the courses of instruction for third year students be somewhat ngmeneu, as, in the opinion of the Association, they contain more work than can be done in the time at disposal; (3) that the classification of schools as \"excellent,\" \"good,\" and \"fair be dis- pensed with (4) that the three proposed variable grants be reduced to two, and that there be less differ- ence between the grants than that proposed (5) that the attendance grant be paid on the average at tend- ance (6) that very great latitude should be allowed to committees in drawing up courses of instruction for organised evening science schools. These points were urged by the various speakers. A long discus- sion, lasting over two hours, ensued, at the end of which Mr. Acland stated that he hoped to be able on many of these points to meet the wishes of the depu- tation, and promised at the end of a week or 10 da^s to make a definite statement of the alterations the department would be prepared to make.",

A meeting of the council of the South Wales College was held on Monday afternoon, at the Cardiff Town-hall. The Very Rev. the Dean of Llandaff (Dr Vaug-han) presided, and there were present, the Rev. Dr. Roberts, the Rev. N. Thomas, the Rev D. Evans, Mr L. Tylor, Mr L. Carr, and the principal. Letters were read from Sir Hussey Vivian, M.P., in which he expresses himself to the effect that the college council has acted wisely in deciding as a temporary measure to rent the old infirmary. Sir Hussey also dis- cusses the question of a permanent site. The formal resolutions of the infirmary committee were communicated to the college council, From these it appeared that the college council are to rent the old infirmary at J6400 per annum, the tenancy to commence in September, and to be liable to six months' notice on either side\u2014the college council to pay for all re- pairs and rates and taxes. The committee of the college council appointed for the purpose, re- ported that they had had an interview with the infirmary committee, an I that the registrar of the college had been directed to forward to the secretary of the infirmary a letter accepting the terms. This letter was read to the meeting and approved of, as was the action of the committee. A formal agreement, setting/mt the terms of the tenancy, remains to be drawn up. The name of Mr Louis Tylor was added to the committee ap- pointed on the 20th August for the purpose of arranging terms with the infirmary committee, and the college committee were requested to take the preliminary steps with the view of making the necessary alterations and preparing the requisite fittings, and to report to the council. The council of the college proceeded with the consideration of the applications for the various professorships and lectureships. The council of the South Wales College met at the Town-hall, Cardiff, on Tuesday afternoon, and, under the presidency of the Very Rev. the Dean of Llandaff, they were engaged for over three hours in the task of examining the claims of the various applicants for the professorships and lectureships advertised. The committee of the council of the South Wales College have now concluded their investi- gations into the rival claims of the various appli- cants for the professorships and lectureships\u2014so far as the selection of a lete to appear before the council on the 6th September is concerned. We understand that out of 19 applications for the Greek chair 5 applicants have been asked to attend before the college council of the 23 appli- cants for the Latin, 5 have been selected from the 15 for the chair of logic, 1 of the 24 for that of mathematics, 7 the 18 applications for the chair of English language and literature have been reduced to 2 in Biology, of the 9 applica- tions, 2 have been selected for the Welsh pro- fessorships there were 4 applications, and from these 1 has been selected 18 persons were anxious to fill the chair of chemistry, and their number has been reduced to 4; in music the applications have been weeded out, and the number, formerly 11, is now 4 for the Trench professorships there were 11 applicants, and of these 2 only have been thought worthy to attend before the college council for the German a similar number from the 10 applications\u2014with a special note bearing upon the claims of a dis- tinguished foreigner, whose papsrs were not complete,",

                "full_text": "SOUTH WALES COLLEGE. INAUGURATION OF EVENING CLASSES. On Wednesday evening Professor Seth (pro- fessor of logic and philosophy) inaugurated the evening classes which are to be carried on during Lent Term by a lecture on Descartes and the Beginnings of Modern Philosophy.\" Most of the professors were present, and tho lecture room was filled with an appreciative audience, many being unable to obtain sitting room. Principal JONES presided, and in introducing the lecturer, said that they wero commenc- ing their evening work, which consisted (as they who had prospectuses knew) of popular lectures, more or less, in English literature, logic, philosophy, biology, Welsh, and music, and in addition there was to be work of a more regular character in Greek, Latin, &c. The regular work would, lie hoped, be of great use to many in the town. In the iirst place, to teachers who were desirous of learning more than they taught; and in the second place, to those who were unable to come to the day classes owing to other work. He hoped also that many would come forward from the excellent science and art schools. The evening classes were not intended as rivals to the science and art schools, but were for the more advanced class of students' Professor SET a began by sketching the charac- teristics of mediaeval philosophy as consisting in submission to authority\u2014oq the one side the authority of the Church on the other side the authority of Aristotle. The beginnings of modern life was traced in the Italian Renaissance. Men were then brought into new contact with the literature knd art of the ancient world, and their historical horizon thus enlarged. Th? revival of Platonic studies in Florence dealt a blow to the authority of Aristotle. In the sphero of religion the revolt agaiast authority led by Luther. The reformers asserted the right of private judgment, but their principle does not mean that every nun is to think and do what is right in his own eyes. The Reformation was also fittal to the ascetic idea of morality in- culcated by the Church. One of the most im- portant ways in which man's regained freedojn showed itself VM in the increase of scientific cunosity, The discoveries of Columbus, Vasco di Gama, and Copernicus, were alluded to as Ciiaicing men out of their rouWae notions. The revolt against authority, and the new spirit of devotion to nature, were united in Bacon, whose splendid eloquence constituted him the preacher of sc;cnce. Bacon, however, did not get beyond eloquent generalities, and we must seek the founder of modern philosophy in Descartes. De\u00bbcartes system begins with an explicit denial of authority and a direct appeal to con- sciousness. The life of the philosopher was then slcetchgd and his mental history illustrated by oxtracte fr\u00abm the \u2022' Di&coursg on Method,\" The lecturer concluded with an aocount of the Tie- { gative- principle of Cartesian doubt (which was distinguished from scepticism), and the coyito ergo snni, the positive principle on which Descartes founded his phiiosopliy.\u2014The lecture was much appreciated, and at its close Professor Seth was loudly applauded.

Dr. Acland, Regius Professor of Medicine in the University of Oxford delivered a lecture in the New Museum on Nov. 40th. before the '^ice-Chan- cellor, many heads of houses, professors, and a crowded audience of undergraduates and the general public, on \"Rabies and Hydrophobia.\" He said the subject was within the domain of the great department of biology, general and compara- tive pathology. Exposition was urgently and in- creasingly needed, and he had once antf again pleaded that a chair should at once and without delay be founded at Oxford. The object to be at- tained was, how hydrophobia came to exist; how it acted, how it was spread, and how it was to be prevented. They had heard enough of late of poisoning air, food, water, and soil; but the strongest of all was. that animals existed who themselves generated them for the sake of poison- ing. No manner of life could hinder snakes from manufacturing their deadly dynamite, nor from using it when manufactured. Having treated upon the nature and action of animal poisons, he said the poison created by the dog was not natural to him. He was himself a victim, and the poison he transmitted he had received. Man, perhaps, helped to cause it in him by his treatment; and rabies, which was his torment and curse, brought about hydrophobia in his protector and guardian. It lay with man to save the dog from the sickness which, once en- gendered, rebounded with terrible force on the human family. Rabies never probably arose spontaneously, but was communicated. The poison might lie dormant years, but if allowed to enter the circulation it was uniformly fatal. It seemed certainly to be by way of the nervous system. They must admit that there was, as yet, no cure known for this disease when once established in man. Most extravagant remedies had been suggested, every form of pharmacy and charlatanism had expended itself through all generations. It was almost certainly preventible by prompt measures taken at the time when the injury was inflicted. The weight of evidence showed that active cautery was the most effi- cacious remedy, and excision. He was by no means satisfied that wouralie poison was the true cure; yet there might be enough to justity a trial of the remedy. Coming to prevention, he suggested, firstly, that the State should impose a rigid dog tax, and should compel every dog to have a collar with the namebf the owner and the number of the licence affixed; secondly, that all unregistered dogs should be mercilessly destroyed if found in the streets; thirdly, that no importation of dogs should be allowed from foreign countries, unless under special conditions; fourthly, to issue with each dog licence instructions as to what to do in case of dog bite-viz., instantaneous application of acid or caustic, and then in the course of a few months' time, as far as science taught them the evil might be eradicated from the country. Nothing could be more reassuring than the know- ledge of how entirely the disorder was under con- trol. The marvel was that they were, and had been, so careless. They might prevent; they could not cure.",

                "full_text": "Cardiff Teachers. SCHOOLS IN THE GLOAMING. When the Cardiff Teachers' Association met on Saturday afternoon, under the presidency of Mr Murray, of Eleanor-street School, there \u25a0was unanimous condemnation of the conditions under which work has to be carried on in the class-rooms during the dull winter afternoons, In those rooms\u2014and they make up the great majority\u2014which are stfll lighted by a central pendant with flare lights, only a very few of the pupils can work free from conflicting shadows, and the strain on the eyes of those seated near the corners can be truly termed intolerable. Nor are those class-rooms which have the bene- fit of incandescent burners always ideal places for children to read or write in. Report* showed that m more than one class-room dur- ingthe last few weeks the time table has had to be abandoned during the later afternoon, and the time filled in with oral and simultaneous work, simply because it takes a week or two to replace broken mantles. To remedy this state of affairs the President suggested that school should meet at 1.30 and close at 4 o'clock during the winter months. But this step needs inquiry beforehand. In manyof Jjie homes the dinner time is fixed by the fact that the father leaves work at 1. During the winter the dinner hour is almost the only time in which the household errands can be run, and during that time, too. a large number of boys in all parts of Cardiff are employed as errand boys by shopkeepers. In face of this the teachers present agreed to bring the exis- tence of the unsatisfactory conditions to the notice of the Education Committee, leaving it to that committee to take the step best calcu- lated to improve matters. A further resolution was adopted expressing the opinion that a large number of cases of defective eyesight existed among the pupils, and urging the Education Committee to have a report upon this matter from their own medical officers. In an address on Educational Supersti- tions,\" Miss Pens-tone, of the Froebel Society, pointed out that slavish imitation in educa- tion led to neglect and perversion of true prin- ciples. Passing to the superstitions prevalent in elementary education, she pointed out that these were mainly a heritage from the system which encouraged the three R's, and which looked for closely meaured results. Both these positions had a logic which was cogent at the inception of the system. But modern biology had taught that the child's motor activities were of immense importance in its develop- ment. Modern psychology had given us the twin doctrines of interest and apperception, which revealed to us why children who had been sedulously taught the three H's during their whole school life were yet unintelligent and uneducated. These subjects should be postponed until the child was of an age to understand and care for symbols in themselves. Infant schools must be re-formed on the lines laid down by the report of the Consultative Committee on School Attendance of Young Children. In the upper standards the three R's should be related to the child's life. Much of the arithmetic taught, for instance, had no relation to the practical necessities within his actual experience. It should be connected with the manual training, the garden, and the shop. Much more time should be given to learning by doing.\" Domestic science to girls sfcould be taught so as to rouse general intelligence, and the work for both boys and girls should be re- vised in the light of the suggestions made by Dr. Dewey, the foremost modern exponent of the Froebelian doctrine of self-activity.",

The British Antarctic expedition, which is to leave England in August, 1910, will have special interest for Welsh people for the reason that the second in command will be Lieutenant E. Ratcliffe Garth Evans. son of Mr Frank Evans barrister- at-law, of Lincoln's Inn, who was born in or near Cardiff. Lieutenant Evans, who is in the Navy, is stay- ing in Cardiff as the guest of the Lord Mayor. He was present at the festivities at Cardiff on Monday, and made for himself a whole host of friends. Genial and breezy, he is a. typical Navy man. Though only 28 years of age, he has had a lot of experience. It is 13 years since he entered the Navy, and he has been captain of H.M. tor- pedo boat Dryad. He has specialised in navi- gation, and has been with the Channel Fleet in H.M.S. Talbot. From the latter he was ap- pointed in August, 1908, on the staff of the Admiralty Navigation School at Portsmouth as examiner and instructor. While in the Talbot he obtained tha Shadwell Testimonial Prize for the best survey sent in during the year. Lieut. Evans is still on the staff of the Admi- ralty Navigation School, and at the present time is spending what leisure he has in assist- ing in preparations for the forthcoming British Antarctic expedition. Lieut. Evans is already a muchJtravelled man. He has been twice to the Antarctic. In 1902, at the age of 21, he was selected to be navigating officer of the relief expedition sent out by the Royal Geographical Society in Search of Capt. Scott and his ship Discovery, and in 1903 he again went with the Admiralty relief expedition, consisting of the Morning and the Terra Nova, to succour the Discovery. The latter was released, and all three ships returned together. On the first of these expeditions Lieut. Shackleton, who was with Captain Scott, was invalided, and returned home with the relief expedition shio. Lieut. Evans, who is full of enthusiasm re- garding the forthcoming Antarctic expedition, was good enough to give one of our represen- tatives a few facts regarding the proposed venture. We he said, aiming at raising a sum of \u00a340,000. Of this sum a considerable proportion has already been raised, and we have bought our ship, the Terra Nova. Our subscribers thus far include Lord Avebury, Lord Lamington, the Stock, Exchange, the Baltic and Shipping Exchange, Sir Clement Markham, and Mr J. M. Barrie, the author. Our advisory board includes Major Darwin, the president of the Royal Geographical Society Lord Strathcona, Lord Goschen, and Lord Howard de Walden. The main object of our expedition,\" added Lieutenant Evans, is to reach the South Pole, and to secure for the British Empire the honour of that achievement. The scientific objects will, of course, be geographcial, geolo- gical, meteorological, and magnetic while attention will also be paid to the study of marine biology.\" Questioned with regard to the scientific ap- paratus to be taken, Lieutenant Evans said that great interest attached to the fact that they were going to take with them a gyroscope compass, which derived its pointing power from the properties of the gyroscope in conjunction with gravity and the earth s motion. It will thus be unaffected by the presence of the mag- netic pole. It is the invention of Messrs Aus- chutz Kaempfe, of Kiel. It is quite a new in- vention, and it should prove of the greatest utility.",

                "full_text": "THE SOUTH WALES UNIVER- SITY COLLEGE. REPORT OF THE PRINCIPAL. On Friday week a special meeting of the council was held at the college. jLord Aberdare presided, and there were also present:\u2014The Revs W. Bruca and D. Evans (Whitchurch), Dr Edwards, the Principal (Mr J. V. Jones), Professor Ker, Mr A. Thomas, M.P., Messrs G. C. Thompson and Ivor James (legistrar). The report of the principal for the past session was read, stating that the session commenced on Octobet 6th, 1885. The results of the examinations for entrance scholarships and exhibitions and of the annual exhibition (which in both cases have already been published) were given, and the report added that the total number of day students during the session had been 165. Of these 27 had attended one course, 14 two courses, and 124 three or more courses of lectures. There was fin increase of 15 in the total number of students as compared with last session, and an increase of seven in the number of studeuts taking three or more courses of lectures. 107 of the 124 students attending three or more courses of lectures were men students\u2014an increase of four as compared with last session. The 41 attending one or two courses only came, as might be expected, from Cardiff and its immediate neighbourhood. There is a considerable increase in the senior classes, but they were still much smaller than the iunior, and would, he feared, remain so for some time to come. Only the better men from the junior classes would succeed in making such pro- gress as would render it possible for them to attend the senior classes with advantage and take the London degree. The standard of the London examinations was at the present time too high for the average Welsh student, who could not, as a rule, simultaneously grapple with so many sub- jects as were demanded at the London matricula- tion (examination. The remedy lay in two directions. First,in an entrance examination and, seeoudjy, in the establishment of alternative curri- culain which fewer subjects shall b3 taken than, are required in the London examinations, The report of the executive committee of the Aberdare Hall was most encouraging, and would, he honed, lead the council to take the further step of providing a hall of residence for men students. Even if they admitted that such a hall would be an experiment., it was one which was of nigh importance to make, with a view of learning whether such a residential system was not more consonant with the feelings and circumstances of the people of South Wales than the present system oi loaging-nouses. The advantage of the latter system was that it enabled the student to adjust his mode of living to his means to a erreater extent than was possible in the former. On the other hand, among the advantages of life at a hall might be mentioned more regular diet, social training, and stricter discipline. He be- lieved that it would be found that both systems would minister to the needs of the population, but it was obvious that residence at a hall would be of special advantage in the case of the younger students.\u2014The reports of the professors were incorporated in the report of the principal, which was adopted. The general purposes committee were in- structed to make preliminary arrangements for the erection at the back of the college premises of lecture rooms for the professors in physics, chemistry, and in biology. A special vote of thai-ks was passed to Mr H. Blackwell, of New Yark, for an interesting set of monographs on the campaigns of the Civil Wars.",

THE NEW INFXEMARY.\u2014This handsome building is being rapidly completed, and during the week the old unsightly wall and low pent house in its front has been pulled down, preparatory to forming the slopes and laying the steps to the entrance. THE DRAINAGE WopKS are going briskly forward in North-street, where a culvert is being constructed to receive the sewerage of Mary-street, Jones's-street, and the drains of the other houses on the Cae-crook estate. The sewer in the Marshes-road is also in an advanced state. THE NEW INDEPENDENT CHAPEL.\u2014The new chapel for the congregation of the Hev.

DOCK-STREET.\u2014-Notwithstanding the flatness of trade the building of handsome houses, to be occu- pied as offices by the merchants and shipbrokers, goes steadily forward in Dock-street, between the Kailway hotel and Mallon's bank the dreary vacant places being now nearly filled by houses either fur- nished and occupied or in the course of comple- tion. MESMERISM AND ELECTRO BIOLOGY.\u2014During the three la-1 nights of the last week Miss Montague drew unprecedented full audiences to witness and applaud her astonishingly clever demonstrations of the occult science and apparent mysteries of nits- merism. So great were the crowds that on each night large numbers were unable to gain admission. The success of this lady and her highly talented coadjutor during their three night's experiments at Pontypool, and the urgent desire to again witness what had so astonished thousands, induced her to repeat them on Monday and Tuesday evenings, which were eminently successful. On Wednesday evening she re-commenced at the Town-hall, which was crowded to excess with a respectable audience. The gentleman whorn we designate Miss Montague's coadjutor, delivered a lucid, eloquent, and forcible address in support of the science, and the experi- ments on new subjects were attended with complete success. TEMPERANCE PROGRESS.\u2014On Thursday evening last a meeting was held at the Temperance Hall, for the purpose of forming a branch society, to be called the Newport and Pillgwenlly Working Men's Tem- perance Association, the object being to hold weekly meetings at which working men only shall be the speakers, and to promote generally the objects of riMG cause in various parts of the town. ie meeting was fixed for Thursday evening, the ,47th instant, at eight o'clock. The meeting aiteiwaids considered the subject of a temperance benefit club, ami-adjourned for a we<;k for further information.

The distin- guished author, who was in his 84th year, had been ill at Brighton for some time, and his death was not unexpected. By the death of Mr Herbert Spencer, one of the most illustrious figures of the century has passed away. He was spoken of\u2014to select a few of the innumerable eulogies that have been bestowed on him- by Darwin as \"our great philosopher by John Stuart Mill as one of the boldest and most vigorous thinkers which English speculation has yet produced by the husband of George Eliot as the organiser, above all British thinkers, of philo- sophy,\" and by a distinguished eccle siastic as king of the thinkers of his age.\" Spencer accomplished perhaps the greatest scientific literary undertaking ever accomplished by one man. He set himself the Titanic cask of going over the whole field of knowledge and philosophy, and to produce a work which would give his views on the whole subject according to one coherent system ot philosophy. The work occupied his life for practically 40 years, and his labours were embodied in 10 volumes. The work is an encyclopaedic philosophy, summing up the evolution of all life and all phases of it\u2014 biology, psychology sociology, ethics, &c. Besides the works dealing with this branch of his labours he wrote a number of books, pamphlets, and magazine articles. Mr Spencer was a son of William George Spencer, a schoolmaster, and was educated partly bv an uncle, the Rev. Thomas Spencer, at Hin- ton Charterhouse, near Bath.

As a member of the Liverpool Marine Biology Society, whose station is on Puffin Island, Mr Shaukiand was engaged in the pursuit of his \"hobby last summer. We extract the following from the annual report of I the society for last year, which has only just been published \"In several previous reports Mr A.. Leicester's work on the Land Molluscs at Puflin Island has been alluded to. During the last year he has made two special expedition* to the island, and has been indefatigable in his search, exploring the bushes, tufts of grass, and rock cranuses high and low from unconscionably early hours before breakfast till dark nijiht, and leafing literally not a stone unturned in his track. He is now supported in his labours by the Rev T. Shankland, formerly of the University College of Bangor, now at Mold [removed to Rhyl siuot< the report was compiled], who made three or four trips to Puffin Islati- during July and August for the purpose of comd paring the molluscan fauna with that of Anglesey \"ind North Wales, and for the purpose of intro dncinir certain species not found on the islaud. Altogether they have found du ing the year 2 2 species of land Voilusua on Puffin islaud, of which five are new records (including Amaha Marginata, A. gagaLes, Yertigi p!lyiri(ci). Mr Shanklacd has drawn up comparative lists shewing which of the British genera of Pulmouta have been found (1) at Puffin Inland, (2) cn Penmon Pjiut, Anglesey, and (3) ond the Great Ornies Head, as follows:- Ttitnetlla, not fouud at all; A? ion, Penmuu, Great Orme; Ammlia, Puffin, Peumon, Great Orme Limax, Puffin, Penmen, Great Orme Huceinea, Pen- mon, Great Orme; V tnna, Puffin, Peumon, Gre it Urme; Zunitca, Puffin, Penmon, Great Orme; Jltl x, Puffin, Peumon, Great Orme; Bulimus, Puffin, Peninon, Great Orme; Vertigo, Puffin, Peamon, Great Orn.e; Balm, not found at aii Uiatntiia, Puffiu. Peumon, Great Orine Achatina, Garyehxum, Acme, not tound at all; cycioitoma, Great Urme. As w>ts to be expectei, this list shows a close similarity between the three districts. Air Shaukland also iuve.-siigaced and arranged tne varieties of Helix uemtJrblill on the isLmd. He found 14 distinct baud-varieties, several of them very rare ones, and he remarks in regard to this species I have neyer met with such a variety and richness of eolour.\" On August i9th and 20th Mr Leicester and Mr Shaukland were occupied in planting iu appropriate 3p^ts (all duly recorded in the journal itt the laboratory) batches of the follow- ing species, which ought to do well Oil the iland, and which they had brought over in considerable quantity from the mninlaad, viz, Arion ater, Arion hortenfis, Arion subluscug, Arion bouiguignati, lamnx flavus, Limax inixiiaas, Awalia iiiargiu;.tA, Helix aspetsa, Helix rufescens, Cochlicopa tridens, and Oarychium minimum.\"",

Summer VACATION CLASSES AT ABERYSTWYTH \u00bb\u00bb Maty laudable and very succeesfui eiforts have been made of late years to extend the advantages of University educaiion and culture as widely as possible. One of the most hopeful of such extension movements is the establishment of summer vacation classes. Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and S Kensington have all done much valuable work of this kind, and it is gratifying to note that the Uni- versity College of Wales, Aberystwyth, is ryiag to extend its sphere of usefulness in the same direc- tion. Successful summer classes were held there for the first time last year, and S pow being made for earrying on olii*ses chn year. The exact Dature of th* work toll bo garnered from the following extraot from the special pro- BDectus\u2014In order to meet the require ments oC teachers and others (both men and womea) whose occupations preclude them from attending the regular college courses during session, arrange- ments have been m.ide for holding conrses of lectures and practical instruction daring the tbrpe weeks from Monday, August 6th, 1894, to Satur- day, August 23rd, inclusive, The object kept in view in the arrangements has been to offer at the fairest possible cost a iourse of study trtily edu- cated in subjects and method, though neaessarily con- fined within a very limited period. In order therefore to concentrate the instruction as much as possible, the choice of the student is restricted to one grcup of subjects. By this method it is hoped to combine theoretical and practical instruction, and in that way impart an insight, otherwise impossible, inta the principles of the subject selected. The- tion will be suited to the rec uirsiments of th Ale who hsve had no previous training in the various sub- jects, and will aim at developing- tAt practical knoiveldge and aptitude-me dis^xngnishe^i from mere tookwork-which are no essential to those who are called upon to take part in the teaching cf others. It is hardly necessary to point out thai the growiog demand in Bohoo.'s pf all gradi s for scientific and technical instruction renders it a matter of the foremost importance that teachers aotually engaged in the work cf their profession should have opportunities of making their teaching in these subjects real, stimulating, and attractive. It is with the view of helping to meet this need that the vacation courses have Been arranged, and also with the hope of making the lectures, labora- tories, library, and museum of the college mere widely useful to the class of earnest students who are debarred from going through a complete coursg of stady.

An extraordinary scene took place on Friday evening last at a mesmeric entertainment held in the assembly room in the quiet and picturesquely situated town of Carmarthen, where the editor of one of the local papers was brought to feel the powers of mesmerism in a way he little expected. Miss Poole, a well-known lecturer on electro-biology and mesmerism, had been lecturing and performing to crowded audiences at the above room during the week, and on Friday, being the day the local papers aire issued, one of them contained I the following paragraph I vincing or of undeceiving the public.\" On that evening Miss Poole commented upon the above critique, and took a copy of The Reporter from her pocket and tore it into shreds before the audience. She then had several young men of the town upon the platform, who volunteered to be mesmerised; and the whole of them, with few exceptions, were experi- mented upon with success, and appeared to be com- pletely at her bidding. While this was going on the editor'of \"the above newspaper entered the room, and, being recognised by the doorkeeper, was ordered out but be refused to leave. The .doorkeeper then ap- pealed to Miss Poole if he should send for a policeman to turn him out, and she replied, \"Let. him alone; I have policemen of iny own. We will have sOthe fun directly.\" And addre-ssing about eight of the young men on whom she had been operating, but who were then apparently awake, she said, \"There is a person in this audience whom I want you to bring upon this platform; go and fetch him.\" At this command the whole of them bounded off the platform and ran to- wards the individual referred to, who was pointed out to them by the doorkeeper, and they laid hold of him and carried him by main force to the platform, ^the audience cheering and laughing heartily, little antici- pating what would follow. But matters soon took a serious turn; for as soon as he was brought near the platform Miss Poole, whose coolness and self-possession had evidently deserted her, seized hold of him by the hair of his head and dragged him upon the platform, the young inen stiill keepings fast hold of him, and there he lay for a few moments, with the enraged lady pulling his hair in a furious manner, the audience celling and hooting at her; but their yells and hoots she heeded not. The editor at last gained his feet, but his revenger still clang tenaciously to him till some parties in the audience came to his rescue. The confusion was now intense, and amidst the hisses and hootings of the audience Miss Poole proceeded with her performance. Summonses have been issued against Miss Poole and her coadjutors who joined in the affray. The affair has created quite a sensation throughout the tqwn, the gentleman attacked being highly respected by all classes. \u2014\u2014qp. \u2014\u2014",

FATAL AeciDBNT.\u2014 An accident terminating fatally occurred to a haulier, named Thomas Jones, on Wednesday morning, who at the time of his death was engaged in preventing the trams going too rapidly be- tween Pontnewynydd and Blaendare, when he was thrown down, and, the trams passing over his body, put an end to his existence. An inquest is about to be held on view of the body. ELECTRO-BIOLOGY.\u2014On the evenings of Monday and Tuesday last numerous audiences experienced considerable wonder and amusement in the town hall at the mesmeric operations of Miss Montague\" which proved to be of a novel and interesting description. The lady seemed to have perfect control over indivi- duals during their apparent unconscious or somnolent state and made them execute her behests of whatever nature she determined. So sucessful have been the performances that they were continued several nights subsequently, which is the best proof that can be afforded of their varied and entertaining character. TOWN HALL.\u2014SATURDAY. [Before C. H. WILLIAMS and FRED. LETICK, Esqre.J PROTECTION OF THE PROPERTY OF DESERTED MAR- RIED WOMEN.\u2014An application was made by Mr. Alexander Edwards, under the 20th and 21st Vict., cap. 85, sec. 20 and 21, for protection, on behalf of Ann Knight, wife of James Knight, labourer, New- port. From the statement made by Mr. Edwards it would seem, that the marriage of the parties took place in March, 1846. That they separated thrice in consequence of Knight's ill-treatment of her; and that he had been sent to jail twice\u2014once for ill- using and once for deserting her. For several years applicant had been maintaining herself by making clothes in Pontypool, for the market, and during that time she had never spoken to her husband, although she met him once in Newport. She now keeps a shop as an outfitter, having acquired the shop and goods by her own perseverance and industry. Mr. Edwards, therefore, applied for the necessary order of the magistrates to protect her effects against her husband. These facts having been spoken to and confirmed by Mrs. Knight, their worships granted the necessary protection. ABERSYCHAN.- TRESPASS \\Villiam Morgan and William Evans were charged with committing a trespass, in a wood belonging to C. H. Leigh, Esq.

                "full_text": "SPIRITUAL MANIFESTATIONS I A SHOEBLACK \"POSSESSED.\" The last meeting of the Dialectical Society was held on Tuesday, Dr. Edmunds in the chair, at which M. Chevalier narrated many incidents of phenomena pro- duced on his merely placing his finger on a tripod table that sometimes evil spirits had come, and by adjuring them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,\" the phenomena had ceased. Mr. T. Percival stated that for many years prior to spiritualism in its present phase being mentioned, he was subject to super- natural influences; that, once anxious to decide whether he should enter as a student at Cambridge, Oxford, or Dublin, he had a vision. He saw a collegiate room. In it were himself and a person peculiarly robed. Certain incidents took place, and the vision vanished. He de. cided on going to Oxford, when he was puzzled as to the Thirty-nine Articles. A friend with whom he conversed invited him to his chambers. He went, and found he was in the room he had seen in his vision, his friend dressed in the same manner, and all the incidents oc- ciurred as foreseen. Another incident was narrated as to three persons seen in a vision during a journey, which was verified in a few hours. Mr. Percival considered the visions were given to satisfy his mind that he was in the right path, he having prayerfully asked guidance. Miss Anne Black well, of Paris, gave an interesting statement as to the religious views of a portion of the Parisian Spiritualists that she had seen at her own home interesting phenomena, which amply proved that they were produced by unseen intelligent; powers that doubtless there were diabolic spirits as well as the opposite, who produced the phenomena but that as far as her experience went, she was opposed to treating them as \"accursed that by kindness of feeling, and advice tendered to those who behaved themselves wildly, she had results such as elicited from them expressions of thankfulness that some six friends were one evening together, and saw the apparition of a beloved friend clad in beautiful drapery pass through the room, and the spirit recognised them. Herr Erisweli declared that he had witnessed on one occasion that which appeared to be diabolic possession of several persons ia a room;, that he by adjuration caused the whole phenomena to cease that he had caused other phenomena not of that character. In answer to a question, Have you seen mesmeric will- power exercised without any invocation hfl. stated he had not any such experience. His answer amused several persons present who had seen mesmeric phenomena in many phases. Mr. J. S. Bergheim stated that he was accustomed to the phenomena arising in mesmerism and biology, and that persons unacquainted with them should not impe- riously denounce Spiritualistic phenomena as diabolic till they had made themselves practically acquainted with the unseen powers of their natural life that he had seen spiritual phenomena, and that he in one instance had seen a shoeblack close to his office possessed; that he put the crowd back quietly, took the boy's hand, and firmly requested (mentally) that the spirit leave. At once it did so, and the boy was at once restored to his right mind. The Countess of Pomare stated it was not fair and not consonant with the character of the Deity that all spiritual beings not Trinitarians should be considered diabolical, or that His ministering spirits should be of the same grade. The thanks of all present were then presented to Dr. Edmunds and Mrs. Edmunds. This closed the pro- ceedings.",

                "full_text": "YSTRAD MEGRIG DEATH OF MR.. WILLIAM BEBB, CRICKLAS. We regret to anounce the death ofMr. ,William Bebb, of Cricklas, Ystrad Meu- rig, which took place on Saturday last, at the age of 80 years. He was born on the 24th of Decemoer, 1828, being the only son of Edward Bebb, Cilywinllan, Melinbarhed- yn. Montgomeryshire, and was married in the year 1855 to Catherine, third daughter of John Jones, of Bacheiddon. Penegoes, Mach- ynlleth. Both were leading families in that district, and prominent with religion at the start of the Oalvinistic Methodist movement in Wales, during the 18th Century, having practically built the old chapel at Melinbar- hedyn at their own expense, the deeds of which were kept in the family for over a century. Mr and Mrs Bebb started life at Pentremawr, Llanbrynmair and on account of jlrisgreat energy and perseverance it he former soon gained the reputation of being the leading farmer in that district, and although not seeking public life, he was ap- pointed a Guardian for the Machynlleth Union, which office he held for some time. In the year 1871, owing to the purchase of Pentremawr by Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, he decided to remove to Cricklas, where he remained up to his death. He applied him- self assiduously to everything appertaining to agriculture, and the welfare of the dis- trict in every way, especially as regards education and religion. He held the office of guardian in the Tregaron Union for some time, was a member of the local School Board, and was soon elected a deacon in the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist Chapel. Swydd- ffynon, where he also was the precentor and leader of the singing for many years. He was a widely read man. and was well acquainted with astronomy, biology, botany, and all studies of nature, but his chief study after all were the Holy Scriptures\u2014which were the foundation of his strong life. He knew no fear, which, as Carlyle says, is the first characteristic of a man in any way heroic. He had no fear in life, no fear in death, for as he had said several times, I know whom I have believed.\" In life, his motto was, Whatsoever thy hand findetli to do, do it with thy might,\" and in death. he died like a hero. He leaves a wife and five children \u2014four sons and one daughter-to mourn their loss. namely, Mrs Emily Lloyd, Cricklas Mr John J. Bebb, Liverpool, Mr William Breese Bebb, Blaendyffryn, Goginan, Dr R. Bebb, Edmonton, London, N., and Mr. Alfred Bebb, Canada. The Bebb family, like many others, noted especially in Montgomeryshire, are the de- scendants of the Huguenots, who were perse- cuted in France and Holland about the year 1572. Many of them settled among the hills of Wales. notably in Montgomeryshire, from which county they have gradually drif- ted to neighbouring counties, such as Cardi- ganshire, Herefordshire, Shropshire, and Staffordshire. The funeral took place on Wednesday, the interment being made at the Old Abbey Churchyard, Strata Florida.",

It needed only a few days of real sum- mer warmth to convince us that the, high, tightly-fitting ruffle must go, and we have now returned to the long, graceful ostrich feather, coq, or pleated net boas, that we can throw well back upon the should- ers when desirable. For the hottest days we have the long scarves in lace, chiffon- plain, printed, and hand-panted\u2014net and gauze. It would seem as though at no sea.son of the year could we be without some fascinating trifle to fling over our shoulders, when out of doors, but of all those ever thought of, or devised, the ostrich feather boa. is unquestionably most to be coveted. CURIOUS. ABSENT-MINDEDNESS. Although the scrimmage to enter the Throne Room is by no means so great, nowadays at the Courts as it was in the days of Queen Victoria/s Drawing Rooms, when the fear was prevalent tha,t the. Queen would have resigned her place to the Princess of Wales, accidents still occasionally occur to the beautiful and i often very fragile toilettes, and many pieces of jewellery, and loose stones con- tinue to be lost a.t these functions. Quite a collection of ornaments is invariably placed in the care of one of the omcials at Buckingham Palace on the day follow- ing every Court, and the courious part a-bout it all is that frequently handsome pieces of jewellery remain unclaimed. One can scarcely understand how even an American millionairess can fail to remem- ber that she has somehow shed a. valuable diamond necklace, such as! the one tha.t has for some time past been lying uncla-im ed at the Palace. A WELL-KNOWN ANIMAL. PAINTER Some seventeen of Mr Arthur Wardle's pictures are finely reproduced in the June \"Windsor Magazine,\" with an appreci- ation of the artist's work, in which the writer says \u2014. \"Mr Wardle shows us Nature fitted with such unerring precision to her creatures' wants that we can well believe these mem- bers of the mute creaton to he as wise. in their generation, or wiser, than are the sons of men, albeit their wisdom is con- fined to few particulars and lies within a, narrower compass. Mr Wardle has made himself familiar with the distinctive char- acteristics of each beast, and not only does he paint them as they are, but he paints the mimicry, as is called in biology that advantageous resemblance which exists, usually in colour, between them and their environment, the protective colouring' which incidentally helps the various classes against those others which zn prey upon them. Thus the lion he shows us similar in colour to the, desert districts it frequents the tiger with the perpen- dicular stripes of the bamboos, and brown grass of its native ha,unts; while he de- monstrates how the spots of leopards and the tree-ca,t tribe generally, represent the sun and shade blotching of their forests.\"",

                "full_text": "THE GROUSE DISEASE. On Friday, the British Association at Dundee had a thoroughly scientific day, and a very large number of papers on a great variety of subjects were read. Besides these, there was an Anthropological con- ference,\" at which Dr. Hunt explained that it had been convened because the science of anthropology had not had a section awarded to it; Mr. Geikie gave a lecture on the geological scenery of Scotland and the freedom of the burgh was presented to the Duke of Buccleuch, and Sirs Murchison, Lyell, and Armstrong. On Saturday the savans appear for the most part to have devoted themselves to a proper investigation\" and ex- perience of Scotch hospitality. In the department of Zoology and Science (connected with the section of Biology) a shorl discu<&>n took place upon a topic which, considering the time and place, was very in- teresting. A paper was.read by Dr. Cobbold. On the Entozoa of the Common Fowl and of Game Birds, in their supposed relation to the Grouse Disease.\" Dr. Cobbold was very decidedly of opinion that the presence of entozoa has nothing whatever to do with the existence of disease in the bird. The grouse disease had no connexion with any forra. of entozoa and the entozoa were, he said, as much in their proper place in the inside of an animal as man was in his proper place on the outside of the globe. The Rev. H. B. Tristram said he had examined several grouse which lie had picked up in the Durham moors, and found that the livers of the birds were reduced to a sort of puhi. The disease was peculiarly an epidemic, for the healthiest birds succumbed just as quickly as the weakest. Grouse disease was on the increase, and he attributed this to the slaughter of all the strong and healthy birds by sportsmen and game- keepers. Gamekeepers were the most destructive vermin that preyed upon the grouse. A beast of prey when it attacked a covey of birds always struck down, the last and weakest of the flock, but the game- keeper shot the bird that rose first, and thereby the finest and strongest of the covey were decimated. In exterminating every animal and Hird of prey from our country we had destroyed the means provided by nature for\" clearing the land of disea-ed birds. This was an extremely short-sighted policy, and produced effects the very opposite of those it was intended t. produce. Had\" the buzzard and o'her birds of prey been left they would have cleared out the diseased birds, and the grouse disease would never have gained a footing. After a few remarks from Dr. Cobbold, Professor Busk expressed his concurrence with what Mr. Tristram had s tid respecting the short-sighted policy of exterminating all the beasts and birds of prey. It was, he said, the opprobrium of the present time, and was producing direful results.",

Operations in the harvest field have been commenced since the close of last week in this district. The weather of this week is not at all favourable. There are some very heavy crops, but not so heavy as last year. THE FAIR The monthly fair was held on Tuesday last, there being a good attendance. There was a good supply of cows, but the prices were lower than at the previous fair; yearlings sold at very high prices. There was some horses on exhibit but very few changed hands. TREAT TO A SUNDAY SCHOOL CLASS. On Thursday Miss Jones, West View, who was assisted by Mrs. Jones, and Miss Matthews, very kindly entertained the scholars of her Sunday School Class. The party numbering over a dozen sat down to an excellent repast of beef, iamb, vegetables, puddings, tarts and jellies. After returning thanks to their hostess for her kindness. The party left, having thoroughly enjoying themselves. DEATH OF MR. D. MORGAN. It is our painful duty to chronicle the death Mr. David Morgan, Hereford house, which took place at his residence on Sunday morning last, after a long and painful illness. The deceased was well known to a large circle of friends, he being in the employ of Mr. Williams J.P., Timber Merchant, as bailiff, and having considerable practice in the timber line, a post he relinquished, on account of a paralytic stroke received some eighteen months ago. It was quite perceptible that he was fast 'break- ing up' for a long time, so his demise was not a shock to anyone. Mr. Morgan was a most ardent churchman all his life, and had the honour of filling several offices in connection with St. Michaels Church, having served as churchwarden for several years. His loss will be most keenly felt by the choir of St. Michaels Church as he was an excellent bass singer. The funeral took place on Wednesday last. The attendance was not so large as it might have been, owing to the heavy thunder- storm which prevailed at the hour of service. The service was conducted by Rector The Rev. J. F. Rees, B.A. Great sympathy is expressed on all sides for the widow and her large family.",

Y swm ydyw \u00a3261, yr hyn sydd gynydd o taa SSO ar brofits y flwyddyn 1888. Yn ystod y pam mlynedd y fnae y newyddiadar hwn mewn bod y mae Meistri Marshall wedi cyfranu yn v wedd hon i'r drysorfa ddim llai na \u00a3867. Well done, y Times. Yn mhlith y misolion rhagorol a I gyhoeddir gan y \"Wealeyan Methodist Book Room,\" Llandain, nid oes yr un sydd yn fwy poblogaidd na'r Christian Miscellany. Fe ddylai gael lledaeniad helaethach eto. Y mae y flwyddyn hon wedi gwneyd ei ymddangosiad mewn'diwyg newydd, ac yn fwy ei gorfforaeth. Cynwysa 40 o dudalenau, Crown 4to. Y mae ysgrif y Parch Charles Garrett yn llawn werth ei 0 bris, sef dwy geiniog. Y mae y datlnniaa yn dda a tharawgar iawn. Y LLYFEBBYF WESLEYAIDD.",

                "full_text": "COLEG DEWI SANT, LLANBEDR. Ar ail-agoriad y Coleg dydd Iau, yr 2fed cyfisal, derbyniwyd i mewn 45 o efrydwyr newydd. Gwna hyn nifer efrydwyr y Coleg yn 130, heblaw 60 o fechgyn yn ysgol y Coleg, yr hon, fel y cofir, a agor- .Y wyd gyntaf fis Ionawr diweddaf. Cynrychiola hon bob sir ac ysgol yn y Gogledd a'r Deheudir yn mysg yr efrydwyr newydd. Derbyniwyd pedwar o Goleg Aberystwyth a dau o Goleg Oaerdydd. Oherwydd cynydd y Goleg a'r Ysgol y mae angen mwy o arian er gwneyd darpariaeth addas ar eu cyfer. Penodwyd eisoes ddau athraw ychwanegol yn yr ysgol, sef Mr. H. O. Ridges, B.A., o Goleg y Drindod, Caergrawnt; a'r Parch. John Williams, o Goleg Dewi Sant. Bwriedir penodi yn ddioed ddarlithydd o'r newydd yn y Coleg i gymeryd yr iaith Saesneg a'r Llenydd- iaeth. Bwriedir hefyd, mor fuan ag y gellir, benodi darlithydd mewn Biology, gan fod y gangen hon o wyddoniaeth yn hynod ddefnyddiol i rai yn meddwl myned yn feddygon. Y mae eisoes amryw o gyf- leusderau yma i'r dosbarth hwn, ac argoelion fod llawer am eu defnyddio. Credwn y daw Eglwyswyr Cymru allan i gynorthwyo y Coleg i gyfarfod yr anghenion newydd a godant o'r cynydd anarferol sydd yn cymeryd lie yn nifer yr efrydwyr. Agorwyd ar ddechreu y tymor presenol Gymnasium a Fives Court newydd, a sicrhawyd gwasanaeth Sergeant Major Dallison, R.A., Aberystwyth, i roddi addysg mewn ymarferiadau corfforol, megys drill a gym- nastics i fechgyn yr Ysgol ac i efrydwyr y Coleg. Agorwyd hefyd boarding house newydd a thrydedd hostel i fechgyn, ac ardrethwyd amryw dai yn y dref yn hostels i efrydwyr. Pan nad ydyw y Coleg, oherwydd ei gysylltiad a'r Eglwys, yn derbyn dimai gan y Llywodraeth, credwn na oddef Eglwyswyr Cymru iddo fod yn ol o arian. Os gwna Eglwyswyr y Gogledd yn gystal a'r Deheudir eu dyledswydd tuag at y Coleg ni raid i Lanbedr ofni canlyniadau cystadleuaeth a'r tri choleg arall. A ganlyn yw enwau yr ymgeiswyr llwyddianus yn yr arholiadau a gymerasant le yn ddiweddar yn y Coleg a'r Ysgol am ysgoloriaethau a llenfuddianau.

                "full_text": "SPIRITUALISM. A REPLY TO THE REV. G. PENAR GRIFFITHS. Sir,\u2014My attention has been directed to the report of a sermon by the Rev. G. Penar Griffiths, in which that gen- tleman professes to deal with Spiritual- ism. So far as the report is a correct rendering of what he said, it reveals a lamentable ignorance of the subject which Mr. Griffiths endeavours to criti- cise. I will briefly summarise the points dealt with, and answer them. Point 1: \"Spiritualism is a deceiving game and a bundle of naughty and baimsh tricKs. mat aione is su\u00bbn- eient to show his utter lack of know ledge of the subject. Spiritualism on its phenomenal side\u2014the side spoken oi by Mr. Griffiths as naughty and baby- ish tricks\u2014has won the attention of the scientific world. The Italian Scientists 1 have taken in the study of mediumship as \"an outl^yng field of human biology.\" The text book of psychology in Dublin University is W. F. Myer's book, \"Human Personality, its survival of bodily death,\" a distinctly spiritualistic book, and deals exhaustively with +he power of mediumship. It is rather strange to find a university adopting a text book made up of the study of \"naughty and babyish tricks.\" Mr. Griffiths next professes to draw a line between Spiritualism and the Spiritual, which is as reasonable as saying you can have a bung hole with- out a barrel. Next we are told it need- ed nothing more than a tricky hand to prompt the table to dance, etc. But what about a table moving without a hand touching it? And did it require a tricky hand to make the iron axe head to swim? Did it require a tricky hand for the stone to be rolled from the sepulchre? Or to let Peter out of prison? Does not Mr. Griffiths per- ceive that if the .spiritualistic phen- omena recorded in the Bible are true, they must be possible to-day as then ? The law of continuity would render it absolutely necessary. But some people are so fossiled that they can only accept fossilised truths. Ostrich-like they bury their heads in the sand, and im- agine things that never happen. And lastly he says \"it is full time to expose these pretences.\" The Spiritu- alist movement has been in existence sixty-four years, and now Mr. Griffiths is going to expose it. He is no doubt a clever man, but is it not rather late in the day to expose it? Really he might find better work to do, viz., in- vestigate lirst and judge after, and throw away his prejudices. The concluding portion of the report is a despicably mean statement. It is an appeal to prejudice, and not to reason. Now I challenge Mr. Griffiths to prove his statements that the char- acters of Spiritualists are worse than their neighbours. People who live in glass houses should never throw stones. if Mr. Griffiths will study the criminal reports, he will make a discovery, which is, that he is living in a glass house, and his mean innuendos have broken his glass.\u2014Yours, etc., Merthyr. W. H. EVANS. P.S.\u2014J challenge the Rev. G. Penar Griffiths to a public debate on the question, \"Is Spiritualism True?\"",

                "full_text": "Orthordoxy v. Science. THE NEW THEOLOGY EXPLAINED. One of the exponents of the New Theology, Dr. Warschauer, of London, visited. Aberdare last Thursday, and preached and lectured at Taberacle Church under the auspices of the Tre- cynon Unsectarian Class. He is not a stranger to an Aberdare audience, hav- ing lectured at Highland Place Church about two years ago. Since then, he se- ceded from the Unitarian body, and in conjunction with a Congregational min- ister, undertook the pastorate of a Con- gregational Church in London. On Thursday afternoon Dr. Warschau- er preached on What think ye of Christ?\" In the evening he delivered a. lecture on Our present religious un- rest.\" Rev. J. M. Jones, M.A., occupied the chair, and in introducing the lec- turer, he said that Dr. Warschauer was becoming a leader. They looked up to him for the wisdom that would enable them and the Church to get its own Gos- pel preached wisely and well, with in- spiration and with enthusiasm. The lecturer said that the unrest had given them a tremendous impulse for theological thinking. The New Theology was not merely negative, but positive. It was religious and spiritual first, and theological in the second place. Its aim was to bring men and women back to Jesus Christ. As one attached to the New Theology, he would say it was foolish to set themselves in antagonism to the Old Theology. The Old Iheology had nur- tured saintly souls. Nevertheless, he be- lieved that the Old Theology had been displaced by the New, though the churches hardly realised it. They were like the chicken which the Irishman killed. After decapitating it, the chicken ran on a few steps without its head. \u00ab It isn't dead,\" said a passer by. U Ah, yes it is,\" replied Pat, \"but it is unaware of the fact.\" (Loud laughter.) In the same manner, the Old Theology was dead, only the churches were unaware of the fact. (Applause.) During the past gen- eration, knowledge had progressed won- derfully, but Theolcgy stood still. That was the tragedy. A New Theology was bound to come sooner or later. Geology, Astronomy, and Biology had changed their views of everything. Instead of being 6,000 or 7,000 years old, it was now well known that the world was millions of years old. Instead af the earth being the centre of the universe, it had been demonstrated that the earth was but one planet revolving round the sun. Darwin- ism had come to stay, which proved that there had been no fall of man, but a con- tinual rising. In all the struggles be- tween Science and Orthodoxy, the latter had invariably been defeated, sometimes ignominously. The lecturer went on to state that he did not accept the miracles of Christ, such as the raising of Lazarus from the dead, and the turning of water* into wine. Neither did he believe in Christ's supernatural birth, and the Atonement, and total depravity. He be- lieved that the infinite goodness and the ideal righteousness of God had been re- vealed on a finite scale in Jesus Christ. In that sense Christ was God manifest in flesh. A number of questions were put to the lecturer at the close, which he answered. t,",

Did he not assure us to the contrary, we might, not without reason, fear that he has not been having a par- ticularly good time of it. But no; a veritable Mark Tapley, amidst all his depressing surround- ings, he tells us he is enjoying himself Whoever or whatever he may be, clearly he is not a man to be trifled with-\" I am Sir Oracle, and when I ope my mouth let no dog bark.\" This would seem descriptive of his attitude on the sea-beach, and so the poor Colwyn doggies must be banished from the sands and promenade. Then there are those ridiculous boating arrangements women and children wading and paddling in the sea, and worse than all, the more unregenerate of them, pretending even to like it! Is it thus that the serene dignity of Colwyn Bay is likely to be maintained? The charges, again, attendant on this somewhat primitive form of pleasure, for rowing or sailing! Who shall decide if the \"trade\" disagree? Cab-drivers with a lofty contempt for water of all kinds, be it salt or fresh, or for excursions Thereon or Therein, say- ing one thing, and boatmen with an unpleasant habit of winking the other eye, quite another. From the same cause no such luck as a dip in the \"briny.\" Bathing machines to be sure, but query-how much? Sunday arrives, only to usher in fresh trouble. Plenty of churches and chapels, but punctual attendance out of the ques- tion, there being no official time-table of the hours of service. Deprived thus of spiritual and ghostly comfort, what wonder if \"Four-Poster\" turns expectantly for succour to the police! Here, alas! failure again awaits him. Police- men (to quote the language of biology) like all rare or local species, confine themselves mainly to one spot. In Colwyn Bay this favoured region would seem to be Station Road, beyond which, it is said they are comparatively unknown all around, in places where the police are not, the roadways are a desolation, a wilderness of litter, with raging tornadoes of waste paper. Bad as this is, worse, we are told, remains. Your corre- spondent foresees a bad accident in the near future. Visions of a flying horse (there's some- thing in a flying horse, you know) disturb his imagination, and, like a seer of old time, he sounds a warning note and practically pronounces a prophetic woe (whoa!). As night approaches, darkness covers the streets, and though this is not perhaps peculiar to Colwyn, the same cannot be said of its bad lighting. The electric lamps, of course, don't count, but the street illuminants in number and distribution are few and far between. Sir, can we doubt from all this that Colwyn Bay is indeed in a various state? Yet the list of grievances compiled by \"Four-Poster\" is far from being complete. May I be permitted in conclusion to state a few 'of my own? In the first instance, there is the cock-crowing at 4 a.m. practised with impunity at a farm less than a mile away from where I am sleeping. I would also direct attention to the occasional distant howlings of nocturnal cats further, to the rough- ness here and there of the gravel on some of the public pathways, and lastly to a muddy crossing \u2014after a day's rain\u2014situate at the far end of What's-its-name road. Hoping that these letters will have the effect of rousing the authorities from their lamentable apathy.\u2014I am, &c., ANOTHER VISITOR.",

In keeping with the praiseworthy educational activities of several of the leading S.W.M.F. dis- tricts, the Aberdare District of Miners has in- augurated a series of C.L.C. class for the pur- pose of educating democats in democratic sub- ject. Aberdare is fortunate in having two such teachers as W. J. Fdvvrfl'ds (Aberaman), who is taking the economics classes, and our own popular writer, Mark Simrr, who is dealing in industrial history. The first class in economics was held on Monday evening last, when 25 students eagerly absorbed the introductory remarks of Mr. Edwards, and, what is better, the newly-enrolled students were not tongue- tied at the close, .but set to and in keen discus- sion brought out each others difficulties in elementary economics, and thus got them settled. The teacher\u2014Mr. W. J. Edwards\u2014well-known to readers of the Pioneer as a frequent con- tA-ibLitc,r to its pages, lectured on the Scope and Aim of Economic Science.\" At the outset he showed the futility of the general conceptions of economics and presented instead, in their all- enjbracing significance to the modern wage- slaves, the theories of Marx. Very forcibly did he demonstrate that social evolution could only be explained and its causes shown through a knowledge of economics. In truth, sociology was based on economies and not, as was generally supposed, on psychology. With illustra- tions, which went to the heart of the subject, he showed clearly the difference between animal and human societies. Animals ,vert- still modified by the direct contact with their environment, but Tnan had intervened with tools, and these tools and their application to prevailing methods of Wealth production were responsible for modifica- tions in human society. In a word\u2014progress in the animal world was due to biological forces, but in human society it was due to economic forces. Marx had done for sociology what Dar- win had done for biology. After describing pre- sent economy carried on an international scale, Mr. Edwards asked\u2014Why, of all the wealth pro- duced, did so little go to the actual producers? Was the present system of economic exploitation justified? How did the process work ? Was it permanent or transitory P Economics would help us. to answer these questions. The Industrial History Class will get under weigh some evening next week, and already betw^eit 20 and intimated tligir intention to be present at the inaugural meeting. The secretary of the classes has remarked, quite truly, that\" if Mark Starr is as excellent in his lectures as he is in his articles in the Pioneer,\" the students are in for an intellectual treat.\" We know they are. We are not displeased with the numbers that have already enrolled, but there must be literally hundreds in the Aberdare Valley who would be well paid for the few hours that these classes, and the consequent reading, would entail each week. If there are any of our readers who would care to join up they will be welcomed at Aberaman next class night, and in the meantime for place and time of meeting, &c., they should drop a, line to the secretary, Mr. David Henry Jones. 28, Regent-street, Aberaman.",

On Friday, the British Association at Dundee had a thoroughly scientific day, and a very large number of papers on a great variety of subjects were read. Besides these, there was an Anthropological con- ference,\" at which Dr. Hunt explained that it had been convened because the science of anthropology had not had a section awarded to it; Mr. Geikie gave a lecture on the geological scenery of Scotland and the freedom of the burgh was presented to the Duke of Buccleuch, and Sirs Murchison, Lyell, and Armstrong. On Saturday thesavans appear for the most part to have devoted themselves to a proper investigation and ex- perience of Scotch hospitality. In the department of Zoology and Science (connected with the section of Biology) a short, discussion took place upon a topic which, considering the time and place, was very in- teresting. A paper was read by Dr. Cobbold, On the Entozoa of the Common Fowl and of Game Birds, in their supposed relation to the Grouse Disease.\" Dr. Cobbold was very decidedly of opinion that the presence of entozoa has nothing whatever to do with the existence of disease in the bird. The grouse disease had no connexion with any form of entozoa and the entozoa were, he said, as much in their proper place in the inside of an animal as man was in his proper place on the outside of the globe. The Rev. H. B. Tristram said he had examined several grouse which he had picked up in the Durham moors, and found that the livers of the birds were reduced to a sort of puh.. The disease was peculiarly an epidemic, for the healthiest birds succumbed just as quickly as the weakest. Grouse disease was on the increase, and he attributed this to the slaughter of all the strong and healthy birds by sportsmen and game- keepers. Gamekeepers were the most destructive vermin that preyed upon the grouse. A beast of prey when it attacked a covey of birds always struck down the last and weakest of the flock, but the game- keeper shot the bird that rose first, and thereby the finest and strongest of the covey were decimated. In exterminating every animal and bird of prey from our country we had destroyed the means provided by nature for clearing the land of diseased birds. This was an extremely short-sighted policy, and produced effects the very opposite of those it was intended to produce. Had the buzzard and other birds of prey been left they would have cleared out the diseased birds, and the grouse disease would never have gained a footing. After a few remarks from Dr. Cobbold, Professor Busk expressed his concurrence with what Mr. Tristram had said respecting the short-sighted policy of exterminating all the beasts and bird* of prey. It was, he said, the opprobrium of the present time, and was producing direful results.",

A highly interesting report is published by the committee appointed to inquire into the entrance (xaminations of candidates for commissions in the irmy. A number of specific recommendations are nade, the general effect of which will be seen from ;he following proposed syllabus of subjects and narks Class 1, in which all subjects may be taken lp Mathematics, 3000 marks geometrical drawing, LOOO French or German, (300 for colloquial), 2000; English, 1000; freehand drawing, 500. Class 2, in which my three subjects may be taken up. but for Woolwich one of the three must be chemistry and heat\u2014Pure mathematics, including the elements of differential and integral calculus, 2000 marks; applied mathe- matics, 2000; German or French C300 for colloquial), as alternating with the same group in Class 1, 2000; Latin, 2000; Greek, 2000; English history, 2000; chemistry (inorganic) and heat, 2000; electricity, magnetism, and light, 2000; geography, political and 10 physical, and geology, 2000; biology, including animal and vegetable physiology, 2000. \u00b0 One of the most significant sections of the report is that devoted to physical training and development, Several witnesses were in favour of giving marks but on the whole it was thought that this might lead to athletic cram,\" and the committee are therefore content to rely on the gradual development resulting from games and the generally healthy active life encouraged in this country, coupled with a medical test, clearly defined and strictly adhered to. It was found, according to one witness, who produced sta- tistics in corroboration, that generally intelligence and superiority at games went together.\" The Duke of Cambridge, in his evidence, said: There is also a certain number of men who are less physi- cally well-qualified than we should like, and I think in former days they would have been rejected, but the difficulty is to do that now without inflicting injustice upon them. For instance, there was a case of an extremely clever young fellow below the standard. We let him in because he was clever, and in the hope that he would grow, but he did not, either in height or chest measurement, and the consequence was that we had to keep him. It would have been hard upon him to have turned him out, but from a physical point of view he ought never to have come in.\" His Royal Highness, like some other witnesses, admitted the difficulty of a physical test, but he thought it extremely desirable to have one if it could be done. The committee observe that no case was made out for dissatisfaction with the existing type of offieer, and no dissatisfaction was expressed by those who advocated physical competition. Without exception, all military witnesses spoke in high terms of the younger officers. Indeed, General Clive, the commandant at Sandhurst, thought \"officers bigger men now than when be entered the army.\" Lieutenant-General Sir Reginald Gipps, K.C.B., Lord Francis Hervey, and Mr. Whit- more, M.P., express dissent as regards particular recommendations. They see no advantage in the pro- posal to remove Latin from its present position in Class 1 to Class 2, and add: We conceive that the business of the War Office is to follow not to lead the general course of liberal education, and so long as Latin is regarded as an essential factor in that course, it should be correspondingly treated in the schemes of the military examination.\"",

It will con- sist of a general review of the progress of biology. In St. George's Hall also will be given the evening discourses. That on Friday evening will be by Pro- fessor Gotcb, and will deal with animal electricity. On Monday evening Professor W. Stroud wiM ad- dress himself to the very pertinent subject of Range binders,\" and the remaining discourse is to, be by Professor Sylvanus P. Thompson on the suBject of Electricity in the Industries.\" The sections will be the same as usual (a Daily Chronicle special correspondent says) except thftt .mathematical and jihy\u00bbical\"science will haye'a specfal department for astronomy and that zoology will itl- elude physiology. Takifig the two most popular PIU sections first\u2014mechanical science and geography- Sir Alexander R. Binnie, the well-known Lonaon County Council engineer, will preside over- -the former. His address promises to he eomfewhat of a surprise, and will take the form of an inquiry ii to the steps by which we have arrived at our modern conception of nature, when reviewed from a scientific standpoint. In this section Mr. J. H. Glass will read a paper on the topical subject of railway con- struction in China, and make reference to the mineral wealth which might be tapped when these railways are made. Textile manufacturers will, of course, receive full attention, and another important paper is that of Mr. J. G. W. Aldridge, on \"The Automobile for Electric Street Traction.\" The lantern illustrations at the association meetings are always exceptionally good\u2014this year a new departure will be made by the introduction of the cinematograph foi the illustration of this and perhaps some other papers. There will be nothing very startling in the geo- graphical section.

                "full_text": "ARMY EXAMINATIONS. A highly interesting report is published by the cotamittee appointed to inquire into the entrance examinations of candidates for commissions in the army. A number of specific recommendations are made, the general effect of which will be seen from the following proposed syllabus of subjects and marks: Class 1, in which all subjects may be taken up\u2014Mathematics, 3000 marks: geometrical drawing, 1000; French or German, (300 for colloquial), 2000; English, 1000; freehand drawing, 500. Class 2, in which any three subjects may be taken up, but for Woolwich \"one of- the three must be chemistry and heat\u2014Pure mathematics, including the elements of differential and integral calculus, 2000 marks; applied mathe- matics, 2000; German or French (300 for colloquial), as alternating with the same group in Class 1, 2000: Latin, 2000; Greek, 2000; English history, 2000; chemistry (inorganic) and heat, 2000; electricity, magnetism, and light, 2000; geography, political and physical, and geology, 2000; biology, including animal and vegetable physiology, 2000. One of the most significant sections of the report is that devoted to physical training and development. Several witnesses were in favour of giving marks, but on the whole it was thought that this might lead to athletic cram,\" and the committee are therefore content to rely on the gradual development resulting from games and the generally healthy active life encouraged in this country, coupled with a medical test, clearly defined and strictly adhered to. It was found, according to one witness, who produced sta- tistics in corroboration, that generally intelligence and superiority at games went together.\" The Duke of Cambridge, in his evidence, said: There is also a certain number of men who are less physi- cally well-qualified than we should like, and I think in former days they would have been rejected, but the difficulty is to do that now without inflicting injustice upon them. For instance, there was a case of an extremely clever young fellow below the standard. We let him in because he was clever, and in the hope that he would grow, but he did not, either in height or chest measurement, and the consequence was that we had to keep him. It would have been hard upon him to have turned him out, but from a physical point of view he ought never to have come in.\" His Royal Highness, like some other witnesses, admitted the difficulty of a physical test, but he thought it extremely desirable to have one if it could be done. The committee observe that no case was made out for dissatisfaction with the existing type of offieer, and no dissatisfaction was expressed by those who advocated physical competition. Without exception, all military witnesses spoke in high terms of the younger officers. Indeed, General Clive, the commandant at Sandhurst, thought \"officers bigger men now than when he entered the army.\" Lieutenant-General Sir Reginald Gipps, K.C.B., Lord Francis Hervey, and Mr. Whit- more, M.P., express dissent as regards particular recommendations. They see no advantage in the pro- posal to remove Latin from its present position in Class 1 to Class 2, and add: We conceive that the business of the War Office is to follow not to lead the general course of liberal education, and so long as Latin is regarded as an essential factor in that course, it should be correspondingly treated in the schemes of the military examination.\"",

(Vice President of the Council), who was ac- companied by Major-General Sir John Donnelly, at the offices of the Science and Art Department, South Kensington, on the subject of the new rules for organised science schools. The deputation consisted of\u00b0the president of the association, Mr. A. Scott (South Shields Higher Grade School), Mr. John (South Shields Higher Grade School), Mr. John Bidgood (Gateshead Higher Grade School), Dr. Forsyth (Central Higher Grade School, Leeds), the Rev. George Towner (Car- penters' Company's Institute, Stratford), Mr. W. G. Constable (Derby Higher Grade School), and the secretary, Mr. W. Dyche. The deputation was the outcome of a very large and representative meeting of the association, held at Derby, on Feb- ruary 23, to consider the new rules for organised science schools lately issued by the Department, The importance of the new regulations lies in the fact, that under them will be inaugurated and carried on a system of secondary schools under the control d, and supported to a great extent by, the Science and Art Department. The organised science schools at present in existence include nearly all the more important higher grade schools, the day schools of technical institutions, and a considerable number of grammar schools. fho principal changes proposed in the new rules are the partial substitution of inspection for examination, tho introduction of special courses of instruction .for women students, the inclusion of a fair proportion of literary work in the curriculum, and the addition to it of jiractical work in physics and biology. The principal modifications suggested by the deputation were (1) That students should be allowed to enter the schools at a somewhat earlier age than is now proposed (2) that the courses of instruction for third year students be somewhat lightened, as, in the opinion of the Association, they contain more work than can be done in tho time at disposal; (3) that the classification of schools as \"excellent,\" \"good,\" and \"fair \"be dis- pensed with (4) that the three proposed variablo grants be reduced to two, and that there be less differ- ence between the grants than that proposed (5) that the attendance grant be paid on the average attend- ance (6) that very great latitude should be allowed to committees in drawing up courses of instruction for organised evening science schools. These points were urged by the various speakers A. long discus- sion, lasting over two hours, ensued, at the end of which Ir. Acland stated that he hoped to be able on many of these points to meet the wishes of the depu- tation, and promised at the er. d of a week or 10 days to make a definite statement of the alterations the department would be prepared to make.",

The Presi- dent, Sir William Turner, of Edinburgh University, will deliver his opening address at St. George's Hall on Wednesday evening, September 5. It will con- sist of a general review of the progress of biology. In St. George's Hall also will be given the evening discourses. That on Friday evening will be by Pro- fessor Gotch, and will deal with animal electricity, On Monday evening Professor W. Stroud will ad- dress himself to the very pertinent subject of Range Finders,\" and the remaining discourse is to be by Professor Sylvanus P. Thompson on the subject of Electricity in the Industries.\" The sections will be the same as usual (a Daily Chronicle special correspondent says) except that mathematical and physical science will have a special department for astronomy and that zoology will in- clude physiology. Taking the two most popular sections first-mechanical science and geography- Sir Alexander R. Binnie, the well-known London County Council engineer, will preside over the former. His address promises to be somewhat of a surprise, and will take the form of an inquiry ir.to the steps by which we have arrived at our modern conception of nature, when reviewed from a scientific standpoint. In this section Mr. J. H. Glass will read a paper on the topical subject of railway con- struction in China, and make reference to the mineral wealth which might be tapped when these railways are made. Textile manufacturers will, of course, receive full attention, and another important paper is that of Mr. J. G. W. Aldridge, on \"The Automobile for Electric Street Traction.\" The lantern illustrations at the association meetings are always exceptionally good-this year a new departure will be made by the introduction of the cinematograph foi the illustration of this and perhaps some other papers. There will be nothing very startling in the geo- graphical section. It is astonishing what a numbez of explorers are at present in South Africa-thougb they are not engaged in exploring-and it is from ex. plorers, of course, that the most interesting contribu- tions come. However, there will be present such well- known travellers and geographers as Captain Deasy. Captain E. S. Grogan, and Mr. Borchgrevinck.

                "full_text": "THE GROUSE DISEASE. On Friday, the British Association at Dundee bad a thoroughly scientific day, and a very large number of papers on a great variety of subjects were read. Besides these, there was an Anthropological con- ference,\" at which Dr. Hunt explained that it had been convened because the science of anthropolo'/y had not had a section awarded to it; Mr. Geikie gave a lecture on the geological scenery of Scotland and the freedom of the burgh was presented to the Duke of Buccleuch, an, I S i rs Murchison, Lyell, and Armstrong. On Saturday the savans appear for the most part to have devoted themselves to a proper investigation and ex- perience of Scotch hospitality. In the department of Zoology and Science (connected with the section of Biology) a short, discussion took place upon a topic which, considering the time and place, was very in- teresting. A paper was read by Dr. Cobbold, On the Entozoa of the Common Fowl and of Game Birds, in their supposed relation to the Grouse Disease.\" Dr. Cobbold was very decidedly of opinion that the presence of entozoa has nothing whatever to do with the existence of disease in the bird. The grouse disease had no connexion with any form of entozoa and the entozoa were, he said, as much in their proper place in the inside of an animal as man was in his proper place on the outside of the globe. The Rev. H. B. Tristram said he had examined several grouse which he had picked up in the Durham moors, and found that the livers of the birds were r- duced to a sort of pule. The disease was peculiarly an epidemic, for the healthiest birds succumbed just as quickly as the weakest. Grouse disease was on the increase, and he attributed this to the slaughter of all the strong and healthy birds by sportsmen and game- keepers. Gamekeepers were the most destructive vermin that preyed upon the grouse. A beast of prey when it attacked a covey of birds always struck down the last and weakest of the flock, but the game- keeper shot the bird that rose first, and thereby the finest and strongest of the covey were decimated. In exterminating every animal and bird of prey from cur country we had destroyed the means provided by nature for clearing the land of diseased birds. This was an extremely short-sighted policy, and produced effects the very opposite of those it was intended to produce. Had the buzzard and other birds of prey been left they would have cleared out the diseased birds, and the grouse disease would never have gained a footing. After a few remarks from Dr. Cobbold, Professor Busk expressed his concurrence with what Mr. Tristram had said respecting the short-sighted policy of xterm inating all the beasts and birds of prey. It was, he said, the opprobrium of the present time, and was producing direful results.",

The \"split\" in Liverpool\u2014arising out of the famous Chatham-street case is, it appears, becoming more pronounced. It is reported that three new causes have now been established by the dissentients in various parts of the city, while another church and several Sunday Schoolsi are being formed across the water in Birkenhead, the whole \"to be under* the supervision\" of Mr W. O. Jones,. The Oswestry Town Council have decided to apply for the transfer of the license of the Three Tuns Inn, which is the property of the corporation. The house will be conducted on the lines of the Bishop of Chester's scheme, Intoxicating liquors will be kept in the back- ground, and a. commission paid to the manager on the sale of everything but intoxicating li- quors. After paying five per cent, upon the capital, the balance of the earnings will be es- pemded in public improvements. The Sub-Committee appointed for the purpose by the Committee of Welsh peers and members of Parliament have completed the drafting of a petition to his Majesty praying that the Pnnei- pality may receive recognition in the Arms of the Prince of Wales, whenever that title is re- I vived, and the petition will, in, due course, be forwarded to the proper quarter. A similar petition in favour of the recognition of Wales in the Royal Arms was unsuccessful. The Sub- Qommxtrtee consisted of Mr Alflred Tjhomas, M.P., Lord Aberdare, the Hon.

                "full_text": "OYSTER CULTURE IN NORTH WALES, Professor White, of the University Col- lege of North Wales, Bangor, wno has been delivering a course of lectures during the winter and spring at the various centres in Carnarvonshire, delivered the twelfth and last of the series at the University College, Ban- gor, on Friday. In the unavoidable absence of Principal Reichel, Mr Howard Lewis oc- copied the chair. The snbject of the lecture was Oyster Culture.\" After referring to the great esteem in which the oyster had been held j from early times, the lecturer proceeded to describe its structure, development, and the fixation of the spat. He pointed out that the culture of the oyster was neccessitated not only on account of reckless depredations which had been made, and were in some cases still being made, on natural oyster grounds, but also on aooount of a demand for an in- cessant supply. He drew attention to the fact that it was a professor of biology who saved by his exertions the oyster industry in France when it was on the high road to ruin. Yet even now the ordinary practical\" fisher- man presumed to ask what there was for the man of soience to teach him. At Conway another object-lesson presented itself, but it would take time to rub such lessons in. The lecturer then traced the gradual rise of oyster culture from ancient to modern time, describing in some detail the systems in vogue in the chief oyster-producing countries. From all that he had seen and read he was not hopeful that the artificial system of raising young oysters could ever be carried out 14 this country with the success it met with in such places as Arcachon, in France. Climatio conditions in this country I were not always favourable. One year there might be a good deposition of spat, in another practically none. He drew attention to the chief places in England where attempts in this direction had been made, and referred to the experiments carried out by Mr J. T. Cun- ningham in Cornwall. He hoped that they would ultimately lead to oyster-rearing on a commercial scale. Last year, Mr James Law- son, of Liverpool, made a gift of \u00a315 to the college for experiments in oyster culture in the Menai Straits. Two large crates filled with tiles on the one hand and slates on the other were set down in the estuary of the Ogwen\u2014a natural oyster ground\u2014but he regretted to say that there was a poor fall of spat last year, and the experiment was not successful. The experi- ment, however, would be repeated this year, and with the \u00a320 recently allocated to him by the Lancashire and Western Sea Fisheries Com- mittee he intended to carry it out on a larger scale. The lecture was illustrated throughout by lantern slides and with specimens, and was i listened to with much interest.",

SAD BATHING FATALITY AT RED WHARF BAY. The deputy-coroner for Anglesey yester- day held an inquest on the bodies of Ed- mund Walker, Selly Park. Birmingham, and Elsie, his daughter, aged eleven, who were drowned at Red Wharf Bay on Tuesday under distressing circumstances. From the evidence it appeared that the father was bathing with his children when Elsie dis- appeared. The father made desperate at- tempts to rescue his daughter, but was un- successful, and both were drowned. They had only arrived at Red Wharf a few days had only arrived at Red Wharf a few davs previously. The jury returned a verdict of accidental drowning, and passed a vote of sympathy with the widow. The father was a proficient swimmer. NORTH WALES POOR-LAW CONFER- ENCE. The North Wales Poor-Law Conference was continued yesterday at Ruthin, under the presidency of Col. Cornwallis West. Rev J. F.

After serving for three years Guard- ians were then becoming very useful mem- bers. but the knowledge they had acquired had often to be sacrificed, and they had to give way to another who was anxious to secure distinction as a Guardian. Know- ledge of the poor-law could not be acquired in so short a time, and a Guardian should be allowed to retain office for six years (applause). The chairman should be allowed to retain office for a longer per- iod (applause). \u2014 Mr R. Harding Roberts, Holvwell, the secretary, read a resolution passed by the Dolgelley Guardians to the effect that owing to the great increase in I the number of vagrants during recent years the Board desired to call the conference's attention to it. and to the necessitv nf nni- r form I uJ r; 11 all 0\\ CI T h e \u25a0'Oilliirj to bl'inri j; Lout a decrease in number. \u2014 After some discussion it was decided to convene a meet ing of the chairmen of tho North Wales Unions with a tiew of adopting uniform treatment of the vagrancy class.

Mae Longfellow yn desgrifio y cyflwr yna fel hyn: \"This life of ours is a wild Eolian harp with many a joyous strain, but under it runs a perpetual wail, as if souls were in pain.\" Mae y syniad mytholaidd yma o fab Duw wedi ei eni o wraig, wedi blaguro o'r medd- wl dynol, ac wedi impio yr un fath yn my&g holl wahanol bobloedd y byd, a chan ei fod wedi tyfu o'r meddwl, mae yn rhaid fod rhywun wedi ei blanu yn y meddwl, fod yr hedyn ynddo er yn guddiedig, dyna ydyw deddf bywydol- -iaeth. Mae yr un ddeddf i'w chanfod yn mhob bywyd; mae pob bywyd yn cynyrchu ei rywogaeth benodol ei hun, llysiau yn cynyrchu llysiau, aderyn aderyn, anifail anifail, pysgodyn bys- godyn, a dyn ddyn. Pe cymerech ddau ronyn unigol o rawn gwahanol dywed- er corn a gwenith a'u planu ochr yn ochr yn yr un pridd, ac i bob hedyn sugno ei ddewis elfenau ei hun o'r un pridd, ac o'i gylchyddiaeth ei hun, beth fyddai y canlyniad? Gyrai yr hedyn corn allan gorn, a'r hedyn gwenith, wenith. Mae'r dynion sydd yn astudio bywydegaeth (biology) yn galw y ddeddf yma yn ddeddf ymgyd- ffurfiad rhywogaeth, \"The law of con- formity to type.\" Onid yw yn rhesym- ol tybio fod yr un ddeddf yn Ilywodr- aethu cynyrchiant y meddwl dynol? Mae Drummond yn dweyd ei fod. Mae cyneddf gynreddfol mewn bywyd meddyliol mor gywir a digyfeiliorn ag ydyw greddf mewn bywyd anifeilaidd. \"Os felly,\" gofyna rhywun, \"Paham nas gall y meddwl gynyrchu meddyl- ddrych perffaith, megys y mae yr ader- yn yn adeiladu nyth perffaith am y tro cyntaf,\" dywedaf i chwi, am fod y meddylddrych wedi ei lunio a'i ffurfio mewn mold lygredig, wedi ei anffurfio gan bechod, drwy anufudd-dod i'r cym- ellydd pur a blanwyd ynddi ar y de- chreu gan y Creawdwr.

Mae y syniad wedi ei'ddadlenu a'i ddadguddio filoedd o flynyddau cyn Crist yn mhlith holl bobloedd y byd, ond fod ei burdeb llachar wedi ei dyw- yllu gan ofergoeliaeth, nes Ilithro i gaddug yn ddyfnach, ddyfnach, hyd nes y \"daeth cyflawnder yr amser,\" ac y danfonodd Duw ei Fab wedi ei wneuthur o wraig; \"wedi ei wneuthur dan y ddeddf, fel y prynai y rhai oedd o dan y ddeddf, fel y derbyniem y mabwysiad.\" Mae y syniad o Fab Duw yn cymeryd natur dyn mor eglur, mor brofedig yn y gyfatebiaeth, fel nas gallaf byth ameu yr egwyddor, na phetruso ei mynegi i eraill, er i mi ei chanfod yn nghaddug ofergoeliaeth chwedloniaeth baganaidd. A dyna orchymyn Crist, \"Yr hyn yr wyf fi yn ei ddywedyd wrthych yn y tywyllwch, dywedwch yn y goleuni, a'r hyn a glywch yn y glustpregethweh ar ben- au y tai.\" Mae y meddylddrych arall yr un mor eglur, y meddylddrych fod Duw yn Un mewn sylwedd, ac yn dri Pherson mewn gwahanfodaeth (individuality) yr oedd wedi ei blanu yn y meddwl, tyfodd allan o hono, cyhoeddwyd ef drwy y byd yn mhlith yr holl bobloedd, a'r holl genedloedd, yr oedd yn yr holl gredoau, a dyma sydd yn profi gwir- .ionedd a phurdeb Cristionogaeth. Mae profi Cristionogaeth drwy chwedlon- iaeth yn dangos yn amlwg fod y syn- iad yn gyson a'r Beibl. Ceir tri enw ar Dduw ynddo, Jehovah, Elohim,",

On Wednesday evening Professor Sc-th (pro- fessor of logic and philosophy) inaugurated the evening classes which are to be carried on during Lent Term by a lecture on Descartes and the Beginnings of Modern Philosophy.\" Most of the professors were present, and the lecture room was filled with an appreciative audience, many being unable to obtain sitting room. Principal JOXES presided, and in introducing the lecturer, said that they were commenc- ing their evening work, which consisted (as they who had prospectuses knew) of popular lectures, more or less. in English literature, logic, philosophy, biology, Welsh, and music, and in addition there was to be work of a more regular character in Greek, Latin, &c. The regular work would, he hoped, be of great use to many in the town. In the first place, to teachers who were desirous of learning more than they taught; and in the second place, to those who were unable to come to the day classes owing to other work. He hoped also that many would come forward from the excellent science and art schools. The evening classes were not intended as rivals to the science and art schools, but were for the more advanced class of students. Professor SETH began by sketching the charac- teristtcs of mediseval philosophy as consisting in submission to authority\u2014on the one side the authority of the Church on the other side the authority of Aristotle. The beginnings of modern life was traced in the Italian Renaissance. Men were then brought into new contact with the literature and art of the ancient world, and their historical horizon thus enlarged. The revival of Platonic studies in Florence dealt a blow to the authority of Aristotle. In the sphere of religion the revolt against authority was led by Luther. The reformers asserted the right of private judgment, but their principle does not mean that every man is to think and do what is right in his own eyes. The Reformation was also fatal to the ascetic idea of molality in- culcated by the Church. One of fctass most im- portant ways iu which man's regained freedom showed itself was in the increase of scientific curiosity. The discoveries of Columbus, Vasco di Gama, and Copernicus, were alluded to as shaking men out of their routine notions. The revolt against authority, and the new spirit of devotion to nature, were united in Bacon, whose splendid eloquence constituted him the preacher of science. Bacon, however, did not get beyond eloquent generalities, and wo must seek the founder of modem philosophy in Descartes Descartes' system bogms with an explicit denial of authority and a direct appeal to con- sciousness. The lile of the philosopher was then sketched and his mental history illustrated by extracts from the Discourse on Method.\" The iq^turer concluded with an account of the ne- gative principle of Cartesian doubt (which was distinguished from scepticism), and the coyito trgo sum, the positive principle on which Descartes founded his philo.i >hy.\u2014The lecture was much appreciated, and at its close Professor was loudly applauded. Principal JON&S said they wore s'oing to do without votes of thanks, and stated that no expres- sion of their gratitude could adequately express their thanks to Professor Soth for the interesting and powerful lecture to which they had listened. An announcement was by the Ilegisirar that tickets for the evening classes could in all cases be obtained after the first lecture in each course,",

                "full_text": "SCIENCE NOTES. WRITTEN SPKCIALLY FOR THIS PAPER.] IT is now evident that all domesticated or semi- domesticated animals succumb to inoculation with the virus of rabies. The possibility of the disease affectiug half-wild animals, however, seems to have been lost sight of, and it was with much surprise that the public learned last year that the deer in Richmond Park were attacked by the malady. Apart teom the general interest attaching to the welfare of the public using the park, and beyond the special interest felt by the veterinary profession in the clearing up of this strange and novel condition, the outbreak afforded an opportunity for in- vestigating this disease under practically new circumstances. The reports which Mr. Cope and Professor Horsley have furnished to the Privy Council contain many points which fill up certain blanks in our scientific information on the subject. The Roe defr, so gentle and timid normally, become exceedingly fierc'3 and savage, rivalling the rabid horse. The mental perversion which leada a rabid dog to one moment lick fondly another dog placed with it and the next moment to violently bite it, finds its parallel iu the case of the deer. Considering how easily the disease is spread, it is a matter for regret that the so-called Vivi- section Act prevents, to all intents and purposes, an outbreak of this horrible malady being recognised in this country,and the simple tests of M. Pasteur cannot be applied until much valuable time is lost. Dr. Dallinger has done magnificent work in Biology in a field which is justly looked upon as his own. In his recently delivered address as retiring President of the Royal Microscopical Society, he gives ;in instance of how easily a young worker in that field can be deceived by what appears like a fact over-riding philosophy. Eighteen years says the worthy doctor, I was paying much attention to Vorticellae. I was observing with some pertinacity Vorticelta convallaria. One of the group was in a strange state, while the remainder were in full normal activity. I watched with great interest and care, and have in my folio still the draw- ings made at the time. The stalk carrying this calyx fell upon the branch of vegetable matter to which the specimen was attached, and the calyx became perfectly globular, and at length there emerged from it a small form and crept over the branch. It was tortoise like in shape. I found that it soon swam, and I recognised it as being a distinct Infusoria to the Vorticellan.\" Here is apparently a clear case of evolution of one thing into another but, as Dr. Dallinger says, Science rejoices in the truth, and two years later he was able to clear up the mystery. It appears that these microscopic organism do not hesitate to make a home in the interiors of one another, and there can be no doubt that this is the key to the cases which are reported again and again of minute forms suddenly changing into forms wholly unlike. This, of course, does not affect the Darwinian hypothesis. The proverbial pink tape which is at present placing the scientific candidate at such a dis- advantage in the Woolwich examination is being severely pulled just now. If one thing is more useful to our officers than another, it is, without doubt, a knowledge of science; but, strange to say, that is the very thing that our enlightened examiners encourage least. Practi- cally the study of science is discourag-ed, for the simple reason that very few \"marks\" are offered for papers in scientific subjects.",

                "full_text": "BfJIRITUcAL MANIFESTATIONS: A SHOEBLACK \"POSSESSED.\" 'The last meeting of the Dialectical Society was held <dn Tuesday, Dr. Edmunds in the chair, at which M. 'Chevalier narrated many incidents of phenomena pro- duced on his merely placing his finger on a tripod table that sometimes evil spirits had come, and by adjuring them in the name of the \"Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,\" the phenomena had ceased. Mr. T. Percival stated that for many years prior to spiritualism in its present phase being mentioned, he was subject to super- natural influences; that, once anxious to decide whether he should enter as a student at Cambridge, Oxford, or Dublin, he had a vision. He saw a collegiate room. In it were himself and a person peculiarly robed. Certain incidents took place, and the vision vanished. He de- cided on going to Oxford, when he was puzzled as to the Thirty-nine Articles. A friend with whom he conversed invited him to his chambers. He went, and found he was in the room he had seen in his vision, his friend dressed in the same manner, and all the incidents oc- curred as foreseen. Another incident was narrated as to three persons seen in a vision during a journey, which was veritied in a few hours. Mr. Percival considered the visions were given to satisfy his mind that he was in the right path, he having prayerfully asked guidance. Miss Anne Blackwell, of Paris, gave an interesting statement as to the religious views of a portion of the Parisian Spiritualists that she had seen at her own home interesting phenomena, which amply proved that they were produced by unseen intelligent powers that doubtless there were diabolic spirits as well as the pposite, who produced the phenomena but that as far as her experience went, she was opposed to treating them as \"accursed;\" that by kindness of feeling, and advice tendered to those who behaved themselves wildly, she had results such as elicited from them expressions of thankfulness; that some six friends were one evening together, and saw the apparition of a beloved friend clad in beautiful drapery pass through the room, and the spirit recognised them. Herr Friswell declared that he had witnessed on one occasion that which appeared to be diabolic possession of several persons in a room; that he by adjuration caused the whole phenomena to cease that he had caused other phenomena not of that character. In answer to a question, Have you seen mesmeric will- power exercised without any invocation ?\" ha stated he had not any such experience. His answer amused several persons present who had seen mesmeric phenomena in many phases. Mr. J. S. Bergheim stated that he was accustomed to the phenomena arising in mesmerism and biology, and that persons unacquainted with them should not impe- riously denounce Spiritualistic phenomena as diabolic till they had made themselves practically acquainted with the unseen powers of their natural life that he had seen spiritual phenomena, and that be in one instance had seen a shoeblack close to his office \"\u25a0 possessed;\" that he put the crowd back quietly, took the boy's hand, and firmly requested (mentally) that the spirit leave. At once it did so, and the boy was at once restored to his right mind. The Countess of Pomare stated it was not fair and not consonant with the character of the Deity that all spiritual beings not Trinitarians should be considered diabolical, or that His ministering spirits should be of the same grade. The thanks of all present were then presented to Dr. Edmunds and Mrs. Edmunds. This closed the pro- ceedings.",

Bajgor, who- has- been detiverarg a course of lectures duriuji *be wmtcr and. spring at the various centres in Carnarvonshire, delivered the twelfth anel last of the series at the University Col- >cge, Bangor, on Friday. In the unavcid- able ahsenceof Principal R-;dchei, Mr Howard Lewis occupied the cha r. The- subject of the lecture was \"Oy-ter Cdltnre.\" After referring to the great esteem in which the oyster had been held from early. times, ths loct,urer proceeded to describe its structure, development. tGod the fixation 0 the spat. He pointed out that the culture of the oyster was necessitated not only on account, cf reckless depredations which had been made, and were m some cases .t;J\u00a1 be:ng made,, on natural oyster grounds, but also on acoount of tire demand for an in- ccssaut- supply. He drew atfent on to the fact that it. was a professor cf biology who saved by his exertions the oyster industry in France when it Was on the h gh read to ruin. Yet even now the ordinary ''practical'' fisherman presumed to ask what there vas for the mriu of science to teach him. At Conway another object-lesson presented it- self. but it would take time to rub such lessons in. The lecturer then traced the gradual rise of oyster culture from ancient to modern times, describing in some detail the systems in vogue in the chief oyster- produ.c ng; countries. From all that he had seen and read he was not hopeful that the artificial system of raising young oysters could eiVN be carried out in this country with the success it met with in such places as Arcachon. in France. Climatic eondit 'on in this country were not always favourable. One. year there might be a gocd deposition of spat, in another .practically none. He drew attention to the chi? \u00a3 places in Eng- land where attempts in this direction had land where attempts in this direction had been made, and referred to the experiments carried out by Mr J. T. Cunningham in Cornwall. He hoped that they would ulti- mately lead to oyster-rearing on \u2014 com- mercial scale. Last year Jjr Jamc\u00abs Law- I son. of Liverpool, made a -gift of JE15 to the. College for experiments m oyster culture in the Menai Straits. Two large crate; filled w th tiles on the one hand and si a to s on the other were -set down in the estuaiy of the Ogwcn\u2014a natural oyster ground but he regretted to say that there was poor fall of spat last year, and the experi- ment was not Kiioceissf<il. Thrt exp?nment^ however, woidd be repeated! this year, ana w:tI. the \u00a3 20 recently a^ocated to him bv Laucarsh're. and WeTstern Sea FiFh(>r\u00ceps Committee he intended to carry it out eti larger scale. The lecture was illustrated throughout by lantern slides and with 'p:-ci. mens, and was listened to with much t. 'oreet.",

                "full_text": "NORTH WALES COLLEGE-TRUE PATRIOTISM. Sir,\u2014The following extract appeared in the National Church for this month, and may prove of interest to those who do not read Welsh papers. The trumpets of \"Patriotism\" and National Good have been blown ad nauseam by the Nonconfor- mists, and Liberal Churchmen have dipped their hands in their pockets in answer. But as soon as it comes to the practical working, and the loaves and fishes have to be partaken of, no Churchman Patriot, forsooth is a or National. O dear no only Nonconformists are virtuous men. Mr Reichel, I suppoie, cannot have pure motives, though a Christian gentleman, and a scholar. Why fear Modern History ? Is it because it will teU its own tale too truly, and with deadly effect upon Noncon- formists? The cry has been for \"National Good,\" and lo! the Churchman, though a Welshman, must go to the wall I All honour to the Nonconformists (for they are the overwhelming majority on the Council\u2014there being, I believe, but three Church- men) who had the courage to elect the best man. What a shout there has been because Mr Ratbbone had the (Iudacily (poor fellow!) to mention Lampeter College for any consideratiou, and in fear for his seat has to knock under. O! but there is no pressure -no tyreniiy-no screw ever put on by Nonconfor- mists. 0 I dear no! on freedom and equality, and yet as for the Roman Catholics, who have one college in Wales, if not more, no one thinks of giving them a voice too I If there is not equality ? (which I don't admit), let us have the whole animal. I hope Chnrchmen will button up their pockets until such time as they can be certain that bigotry and selfishness are banished from the Council. PRO ECCLESIA DBI. Tho practically unanimous appointment of Mr Reichel, a very distinguished Oxford scholar, but a Churchman, as Principal of tho North Wales Col- lege at Bangor, seems to have caused deep dissatis- faction among the more narrow-minded of the Welsh Dissenters, who find their mouthpiece in the Baner. The Principal is also Professor of Modern History, and on this point the Baner is simply sublime. \"The appointment of Mr \"Ileichel to the chair of Modern History ought not to have been made under any circumstances \"in a National College, because the greater number of the Welsh are Liberals and Noncon- formists; and the Liberal members of the Council. \"and particularly the Nonconformists, should \"have been wide awake enough to see that. For of \"the six chairs, the chair of Modern History is the most dBlIgerous to be entrusted to any stranger, and \"especially to any person not in accord with the \"national sentiments. Logic, classics, biology, mathematics, and chemistry may be taught with- \"outtouchinsonquestions indebatebetween Church \"Tories and Liberal Nonconformists in this country. But Modern History covers the whole field, and many of the great questions in actual debate between the Pat tiea-dem oc ratio and ecclesiastical. If any doubt the accpracy of our remark., let him advise with anybody who knows the details of the subjectei and the terms of the examinations in this subject at Oxford when a man is contesting for the honour of a first or second class. This \"chair therefore places a professor in a position of adviliitage to give directions to the minds of young \"men, and the Liberal Nonconformists should \"have avoided the danger. And it onaht also to \"have been remembered that Mr Ileichel had reoeived his impressions on these questions, and \"had passed his examinations on them, not in \"Edinburgh, or Glasgow, or Cambridge, but in \"Oxfordl It would have been much bettfr to have \"entrusted this ohair to a Welshman, for many \"other reasons, which we will not name.\"",

I LARUE ATTENDANCE OF TEACHERS I Under, the auspices of the North Walea Counties Training College, Bangor, a summer school i3 being held at the College, and will continue until August 24th. A large number of teachers from all parta of the kingdom are attending tho school, there being no fewer than 200 staying at the Normal College Hostels, while others are lodging in Upper Bangor. The inaugural addrees was delivered on Saturday evening by Professor John Adams, M.A. Prof essor of Education in the University of London, on \"The \"Art of Listening.\" The lecturer said there was a fudamental difference be- tween hearing and listening. A good many people imagined that the only thing they must do at a lecture was to sit still, to be mere passive recipients of what the lecturer said. One must cultivate the principle of active listening, and he would compel all students to first undergo a course of practice in listening. Dealing with the taking of notes at lectures Mr Adams said the best method was to analyse the lecture as it prooeeded, and to take comparatively few notes. On behalf of the city, the Mayor (Mr R. J. Williams) welcomed the teachers, and hoped they would benefit by their stay from a health w well as from an in- tellectual point of view. A four weeks' course of geography and regional survey will be conducted bv Mr Wallace E. Whit-ehouse, M.Sc., L.C.P., lecturer in geography at the University College, Aberystwyth; assisted by Mife Olwen M. Rees, M.Sc., lecturer in geo- graphy at the Normal College. MiE. Isabel Robinson, London County Council specialist in methods of infant teaching and nursery school organisation, will con- duct a fortnight's school for infant teachers on the kindergarten system; a second fortnight being entrusted to Miss Hannah S. Newman, a pupil of Dr. Mon- tessori, who will lecture on the principles and methods of the Montes-ori system. Profesisor John Adams, M.A., LL.D., will give a week's lectures on \"Personality in teacher and pupil;\" Professor J. Lloyd Williams, D.Sc., of the University Col- lege, Aberystwyth, will devote a week to addresses on The teaching of music in school, with special reference to folk- songs;\" and the third and fourth week of this course will be taken by lectures on \"Biology and human welfare,\" by Pro- fessor J. Arthur Thomson. There will also be a four weeks' course of physical training and hygiene, and various courses of education handwork. In addition to the four weeks' geo- graphical course, there will be special lec- turos on Anthropo-geography\" (five) by Dr. A. C. Haddon, F-P,.S. a week's lec- ture by Dr. M&.non 1.

A vote of thanks to Mr Lucas was fro posed by Mr Acton, and seconded by Mr \u00a1 Francis. Mr Acton spoke of the clearness and scope of these lectures of the great interest of the sciencc of its many side issues in biology, chemistry, astronomy, and the like. Mr Francis said thr.t it gave him great pleasure to second this vote, for lie wished to express his sense of Mr Lucas' personal kiudness to him. Mr Lucas had leen a most kind and tender mother to him \u2014(laughter),\u2014for he had never put too much on the plate at once. He hoped the field-lectures in May would be as well attended as the lectures had been, and in conclusion he must be allowed to tell a secret. Mr Acton was going to give a lecture on \"Darwin,\" in Chester-street, for the Improvement Society, and all present might attend if they chose. In Mr Lucas' reply there was a humorous complaint against the large size of the audience, and the great learning of the various chairmen, but many thanks for the regularity of attendance, and the perfect order of the gatherings. After looking at the various specimens and diagrams (under the microscope there were sections of lignite and of deal), the assembly broke up, and thus ended the last of the geology lectures.",

                "full_text": "UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF WALES AT ABERYSTWYTH. A meeting of the Building Committee was held at the college on Tuesdsy, there being present Colonel Pryse, Mr. David Davies, M.P.. Mr. A. C. Humphreys Owen, Glansevern, Mr. Stephen Evans, Mr. W. Elias, Liverpool, Mr. W. Williams, school inspector, Mr. John James (the mayor of Aberystwyth), and Principal Edwards. The committee considered how to proceed with the alterations, and whether it would not be advisable to make a beginning at once with the work of completing the college buildings. After in- specting the college buildings in company with Mr. Seddon, the architect chosen by the council, and dis- cussing the subject thoroughly, the committee decided to divide the whole of the work into four sections\u2014 section A to consist of the south wing, i.e between the Principal's house and the Castle section B, the tower and parts adjoining section C, the unfinished parts under roof near the northern end and section D the unfinished part not under roof in the northern snd. and that portion of the building now occupied by the present science department. The committee re- solved to direct Mr. Seddon to at once prepare a new museum in the south wing of the college and to make a new entrance thereto from the outside between the two entrances now existing. This will not only ,ive a museum almoet twice the size of the present one, but will liberate the rooms now occupied by the museum, which are wanted for lecture purposes. The architect has also been directed to invite tenders B and C, so that in a short time three sections at least of the work will be finished, the completion of section D being reserved for the present on financial considera- tions. A strong appeal will be made to the country to enable the authorities to go on with the work, and no doubt that appeal will be responded to as liberally as appeals have been responded to in the past. The committee had also under consideration the question of providing a hostel for women students, and after much consideration, and the assistance of the new lady superintendent's advice (Mrs Powell, ot ^lan\" dudno) they decided to rent for next session Aber- geldie House on the Victoria-parade. It is one oi the handsome double houses erected on the sea frontage some few years ago, having no fewer than nineteen bedrooms, and being excellently well furnished.. The College was the centre for the London matricu- lation examination held last week. There were twenty-two candidates. The sessional examination ends this week, the session itself ending on Tuesday next. Mr Berry, assistant examiner, conducted the matriculation examination and Mr Howes, of Leeds, \"&in conducted the biology examination in the sessional examination. Professor Wilkins, not being able to go to Aberystwyth and conduct the examination viva voce because he was on the same day taking In8 honorary degree of doctor of laws in Cambridge. Mr Pritchard, of Llanrwst, has bequeathed tl,W to the college, the interest to be used as a scholarship to be called the Pritchard scholarship; and the late Mr David Jones, of St. James's-road, Liverpool, and Brvndedwydd. near Corwen, a native of Liandueriei, has bequeathed \u00a3 500 to the College, to be used in any way the Council may think fit. Mr Jones has also left \u00a3500 to educate young men for the ministry in Merionethshire \u00a3 500 to buy books for Sunday school libraries in the same county f,2,000 to the Missionary Society of the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists; and 1:1,500 in various sums to other charitable institutions.",

The committee of the council of the South Wales College have now concluded their investigations into the rival claims of the various applicants for the pro- fessorships and lectureships\u2014so far a-a the selection of a lete to appear before the council on the 6th September is concerned. We understand that out of 19 applicants for the Greek chair 5 applicants have been asked to attend before the college council of the 23 applicants for the Latin, 5 have been selected from the 15 for the chair of logic, 1 of the 24 for that of mathematics, 7 the IS applications for the chair of English language and literature have been reduced to 2 in Biology, of the 9 applications, 2 have been selected for the Welsh professorships there were 4 applications, and from these I has been selected IS persons were anxious to fill the chair of chemistry, and their number has been reduced to 4 in music the applications have been weeded out. and the number, formerly 11, is now 4: for the French professorships there were 11 applicants, and of these 2 only have been thought worthy to attend before the college council; for the German a similar number from the 10 applications\u2014with a special note bearing upon the claims of a distinguished foreigner, whose papers were not complete. Mr Gladstone, Mr Chamberlain, Sir Stafford North- 0, cote, Lord George Hamilton, Mr A. Balfour, and Mr Osborne Morgan having been advised of the appeal to the South Wales colliers to contribute a farthing per week, such to found scholarships at the South Wales College, have replied. Mr Gladstone writes that he feels sincere interest in all measures taken with a view to the effective organization of the new college for the goed of the Welsh people, and though not able to judge of the idea brought before him without knowing more of its development, Mr Gladstone sincerely wishes, and can readily believe, that it may be found susceptible of most useful application. Mr Chamberlain says that if the project can be carried out, it will be immensely creditable to the colliers and workmen of Wales. The margin which remains to the ordinary working man, after providing for necessaries out of his wages, is, however, so small that he does not think it is to be expected that this class should make large contributions to philanthropic or educational objects. It is easy to say that they can spare it from drink and tobacco, but this is exacting a higher practice from workingmen than the example of any other class warrants us in demanding. Mr Forster considers the movement among the colliers of South Wales to create scholarships most creditable to them. Sir Stafford Xorthcote sincerely hope, that the sririted appeal made to colliery districts may be successful. It will afford a noble instance of self-help. Lord George Hamilton speaks of the scheme as deserv- ing encouragement. It is most creditable both to its framers and contributors. I Mr Osborne Morgan can conceive no object more laud- able than that of founding labour scholarships at such a place of education as the South Wales College, and most heartily wishes it every success. Mr Balfour cannot doubt that a fund raised for such an object will, if wisely administered, have the best results in promoting the cause of higher education.",

SCIENCE AND ART CLASSES.\u2014A public meeting was held on Friday evening, the 6th instant, in the Naiional School, its object being to secure the establishment of these classes in the town in con- nection with the Science and Art Department, South Kensington, Mr Curtis, M.S.A., of Towyn, having kindly offered to commence them. The meeting, which gave good promise of success by the largeness of the attendance, was presided over by Dr Grosholx. The Revs E. O. Williams, M.A., R, E. Morris, B.A., R.

He stated that there were at present about 62,000 to 63,000 students in these classes in England, and as the result of these in- creased facilities many students educated at first in ( village schools were now occupying some of the t highest professional positions in the land.

                "full_text": "\"EVOLUTION OF MIND.\" On Wednesday evening Professor Brough de- livered a lecture on the above subject in the exam- ination hall of the college, to a large and apprecia- tive audience. The following is a \"ketch of the address :-Mind appears in many different forms. The j,lIy fish, the worm, the dog, the man, each show it; but in different forms. Milton holds, however, that wide differences like these are diger- ences in degree and not it; kind.\" There is one first matter which takes on various degrees of life and of intelligence. Mr Herbert Spencer so describes these degrees that we may clearly see that they are mere degrees. Life, he considers, consists in this, that an organism appreciates its surround- ings and adapts itself to them. Intelligences differ mainly in the extent of space and the stretch of time, which their appreciation and self-adjustment reaches. This dcctrine prepares the way for a further one. We may further suppose that the higher intelligences ba-e grown, as the higher nprvous systems have gr wn, Irom small beginnings. The plan of creation was noi t'l introduce suddenly various kinds of mind, !Jut lio introduce ascending degrees successively. So far the evolution of mind is what completes and crowns the evolution of life explained to us in biology. We may also use it as a key for opening tb\" mysteries of our own personal experience. One chief mystery is the menial en- dowments which we bring with us into the world. We start life with some lessons in the art of loco- motion already learned M are ready with gestures to express our shaiies of feehttg we have more or less of that scientific instinct which anticip tea order and law in nature and eg we gradually make ac- quaintance with our fell -creatures we lijitl ourselves loving, hating, f aring, and judging with inborn earnestness. Evolution ol mmd I means that these endowments are given us shaped according to the experience or acquirements of ancestral generations. How the increment!, of intelligence originally arise is a question toij subtle I and uncertain for our present; discussion. \"BUt when once ansen they are preserved and perp tuated by a I clearly known law, that 01 natural selection. In the competitive struggle to; existence intelligence and suitable emotional impulses preserve the specits. t The desires of the weak is often descrie d in our I more melancholy current literature while poets I and prophets form their most hopetul anticipations from their view of the survival of ihe fittest. Finally, I we may compare the meaning of Evolution as applied to mind with its meaning in the physical world Physical evolution is a process of ehange within the physical world itself, taking place in the course of its his ory. But not so mental evolution. The generations of mind. do Dot forw. one continuous world. Each mind is rather a world in itself, isolated. And evolution here means that t uch wind is created at its beginning according to a pattern drawn troro other mental worlds, which have previously run their course and disappeared. Now, without any pretence of scientific argument, but claiming the metaphysician's right of fre\u00bf fancy, we may ima- gine the whole system of the physical world jig if also to be but one of muny syhttiooa which have bad their day and passed. And perhaps the physical world, like the mental, is not so old as it looks. At crevtion it was planned so as to contain the results of a hypothetical development previously.",

                "full_text": "WELSH ITEMS. It is estimated that there is a. surplus of about .\u00a3100 from the National Eisteddfod at Carnarvon. The great falling off in the receipts as compared with previous eisteddfodau held at Carnarvon is attribu- table to the quarrymen of Bethesda and Llanberis having held aloof. The annual demonstration of the Anthracite Miners' Association was held at Cwmamman on Satur- day, when there were about 2,000 persons present. Dr Howell Rees presided, and addresses were de- livered by Mr Cyril Flower, M.P., MrD.Pugh, M.P., and Mr W. Abraham, M.P., in favour of a resolution urging unity of action among the Liberals, and of Mr Parnell's measure for the temporary relief of agricul- tural tenants in Ireland. The Midland and Central Wales Junction Railway Bill and the North Pembrokeshire and Fishguard Railway Bill have been read a third time, and passed. Mr Wm. Baird, for many years chief constable of the Montgomeryshire police force, died in New Zealand on the 27th July last. Mr Richard Davies (Tafolog), Glandwr, Llanidloes- road, Newtown, who was successful in winning the prize of < \u00a3 20 and a carved oak chair for the best ode at the National Eisteddfod, held at Carnarvon last week, met with an enthusiastic reception at the Newtown railway station on Friday evening, on his return from Carnarvon. A large number of his friends had congregated on the platform, and when the train steamed into the station a number of fog- signals exploded, and as soon as the successful com- petitor was recognised by his townsmen he was heartily cheered. On alighting from the carriage, Mr Davies was quickly surrounded, and after receiving the customary congratulations was carried home shoulder high in the oaken chair. The St James's Gazette says The progress of the Welsh tithe war is instructive. Last January the farmers of Llandyrnog demanded an abatement from their rector. After some demur the Rev Mr Williams offered 5 per cent. on the January tithe, and a further 5 per cent. on the July tithe. The far- mers accepted the January reduction, but demanded 10 per cent. on the July payment. Again the rector refused, and again, for peace sake, he has yielded, and now offers the farmers the 10 per cent. they claimed. But that is not the way to deal with agita- tors. The Welsh Celts are as bad to run away from as the Irish. The farmers have met the overtures of their rector by doubling their demand. They declare themselves no longer bound by the too moderate terms of their last proposals. They protest against the unfairness of charging tithe at all upon certain crops. They invoke Lord Beaconsfield, Mr Mill, and the plain teaching of the word of God in justifica- tion of their refusal to pay their lawful debts, and they pledge themselves to allow their goods to be so'd unless the rector bows to their dictation. From 5 per cent. in January to 10 per cent. in July from 10 per cent. in July to 20 per cent. in September. Geometrical progression is the rule in Celtic spoliation weakly met.\" On Monday morning a meeting of the council of the University College of South Wales and Monmouth- shire was held at the college. Lord Aberdare was in the chair, and there were also present the Revs A. Tilly, and N. Thomas, Messrs G. C. Thompson, Lewis Williams, John Duncan, and Louis Tylor. The prin- cipal business was the consideration of plans for the alteration of old premises and the construction of new premises, in order to accommodate the professors of chemistry, physics, and biology. Mr George Robin- son, the architect, and the professors of the three departments mentioned were present. After some discussion the architect was requested to advertise for tenders.",

                "full_text": "PROFESSOR TYNDALL'S WORK. The later statement that Professor Tyn- dall died from an overdose of ohloraJ adds picturesqueness to both his life and death, for such a life ending in such a way cannot fail to strike some minds as an illustration of the helplessness of the proudest science and philosophy. The man who had dragged from Nature some of her most wonderful secrets, who had discovered what was never known before about light and heat, and who had hazarded the most audacious guesses as to the origin of life itself has his days cut short by a mishap in relation to an agent that he, above all men, as well as those about him, might have been expected to be to the uttermost on his guard against. Pro- fessor Tyndall's share in politics was an accident and, even those who sympathised with his conclusions must have generally felt, a great mistake. Although it has escaped mention in the obituary notices, it was his lot as a youth to be a witness of one of those Chartist encounters in the North of England where the soldiers did not hesitate to shoot and kill the political agitators of those days who failed to disperse on the first notifica- tion. Even the part he played in political life, limited and unimportant as it was, was characteristic of the man. He was an Ulster- man, and delighted in controversy as other men delight in meat. Truth to say, the intensity of his own convictions made him sorely intolerant of conclusions that differed from his own, no matter how painfully and conscientiously arrived at. It was the same in his scientific discourses. His famous address as president of the Belfast meeting of the British Association was probably un- assailable as sound science, but it was m dogmatic in tone as the haughtiest priest, fuller of his priestly prerogatives than of the message entrusted to him, could have made any utterance from his point of view. He ousted, and mauled, and pulverised old-world notions of the source of life and being. He left us little, if anything, better than \"mag- netic mockeries,\" and laughed at the distress his philosophical revolution was creating, with scornful, disdainful want of pity. Dr. Heurtley, the Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at Oxford, who considered it a matter of duty to protest against an academical distinction conferred on him by the University, was in Dr. Tyndall's eyes, it is to be feared, a type of all those who ever deem themselves lovers of soience, who by employing processes of thoughts different from his own naturally came to other conclusions. He was not, in those days, content to merely let knowledge grow- he wished a kind of priesthood of science to be substituted for the priesthood of theology which he so intensely disliked. But, great as he was as a man of science, and though he will live through time as the working companion and fellow-labourer of Darwin a.nd Huxley, the world has lived to see that even science cannot afford to dogmatise. The verdicts of geology to-day are very different frem what they were twenty years ago; a neo-Darwinism has sprung up; biology has been largely re-written. We have lost a great, a glorious, a gifted countryman, but even his career shows the need of Tenny- son's warning about the danger of pressing scientific theories too fast and far\u2014\" Let Science prove these things, and then, What matters Science unto men?\"",

The invitation they isitue this morning to coinpetitors for Entrance Scholarships treads 10 closely upon the heels of the appointment of Principal that the one event may be considered u, naturally the sequel if not uactly a part of the other. Perhaps the tttter event is the ouu which will take the more direct hold of the publio mind; that is to say, the publio outaide of those immediately concerned with the practical work of the College. It it the first step towards showing those for whoso benefit the College was founded that in looking after their interests the Council really mean bosineu, and do not intend the institution to be one in which the finding of scholars i. a matter to be subordinated to the provision of a large and costly teaching staff. It is the intention of the Council to establish no less than a hundred Scholarships, a iact in oomiection with which it may be stated that in no case will the number holding Foundation Scholarships lie allowed to exceed a third of the total number of students. Assuming that the College will eventually have three hundred scholars undor tuition, a hundred it, therefore, the maximum number of Foundation Scholar- tlbip. which will have to be provided for. And assuming, again, that it will take the College three years to work up its full complement of students, it will be seen that the thirty- three Scholarships a year, which is the number the Council have fixed upon, just preserve, the required proportion. Besides these thirty-three foundation Scholarships, competition is also invited for tiro Ware\" Schotarthipt of \u00a32Fj each, and infor- mation has reached us, in an unofficial but entirely trustworthy kind of way, that a M uticat Scholarship of t20 a year will be founded by the Messrs. Thompson and Shackbll. The value of the Foundation Scholarships, we may mention, will be from tl0 to 920 each. The Cotinoil will shortly proceed to appoint Pro- fessors of Greek, Mathematioa and Astronomy, Logio and Philosophy, English Language, Literature and History, Chemistry, and Biology; Leoturers on the Welsh Language and Literature, Frenoh Language and Litera- ture, and German Language and Literature; and Demonstrators in Physios and Chemistry. The Chair of Physios will be filled by the Principal. It is believed that the City of London Guilds and Institute will found and endow a Chair of Practical Engi- neering, and that the interesU which suoh studies are intended the more dirootly to serve will do similar service in behalf of the sciences of Geology, Mining, and Metallurgy. W hen the details have been properly settled the College will be one of the beat appointed in the kingdom as regard* professors and leoturers. Having thusoalled attention to ita full and perfect equipment in this direotion, it only remains for us toO point out that for the quality of the teaching there is the guarantee of the Government who furnish the stipends. Having provided a building and an efficient teaching staff, and given proof of their earnest deaire to attract stndents, it is to be hoped that the Counoil will have no difficulty in securing that hearty co-operation on the part of the publio at which they have so steadily aimed. In the interests of Higher Eduoation in South Wales and Monmouth- shire our advertisement, and the facto we have adduoed in illustration of it, will be looked upon as a pieoe of unquestionably good news. And there is even better to follow.",

Mr. Browning's new poem is not, as has been stated, a translation of any work of Aristophanes, but an Aristo- phanic poem, in which the Greek poet\u2014or the English one in his person-says some things about himself that Mr. Browning thinks have not been said, though they want saying. The book is more than half through the press, and is expected within a fortnight. Professor Henry Morley has in the press for Messrs. Cassell and Co. a companion work to his \"First Sketch of English Literature,\" consisting of a series of extracts from all the authors he mentions in his First Sketch,\" with such further critical and other notices as he thinks ne- cessary. We may look for the publication in a few months of the poems, early and recent, of the late Mr. Shirley Brooks. It is known that the late editor of Punch was a prolific master of easy and elegant Mrs de societe. It is proposed to collect all his scattered pieces, published originally in nearly all the chief literary journals that have appeared in England for the last twenty-five years, and to add thereto a biographical memoir of their author. Messrs. Macmillan will publish shortly \"A Course of Practical Instruction in Elementary Biology,\" by Pro- fessor Huxley, F.R.S., assisted by H. N. Martin, B.A., D.S.C., of Christ's College, Cambridge. Mr. Seymour Haden is going to lecture on the best modes of interment, before the Society of Arts. A noble Duke has lent him, for the purposes of his lecture, two coffins of wicker work, lined with moss. f Apropos of the new volume of Dean Hook s, Lives of the Archbishops of Canterbury,\" just published, we may mention that Dean Hook has made great progress with the Life of Archbishop Laud,\" which will form the eleventh volume of the Lives. It will not, however, be published until the autumn. Mr. W. Raw son, whose arrival in Londou with some Moabite pottery was mentioned some time ago in the Athenceum, has published a long account of his dis- coveries\" in the Awferican papers. He states that he found these objects himself, and in situ, in a cave in Moab. Mr. G. A. Simcox is preparing a volume of poems. The principal piece in the book will be entitled The Harrowing of Hell.\" Professor Stanley Jevons is to contribute to The International Scientific Series a book entitled Money, and the Mechanism of Exchange.\" It will be a popular description of the functions of money, the substances em- ployed at various timres for making coins, the actual sys- tems of money used at present in different countries, international currency schemes, &c. Last (Friday) night Hamlet was given at the Lyceum Theatre for the one hundredth time. The fact speaks strongly for the interest Mr. Irving's performance has in- spired, and, taken with other signs, indicates that theatrical taste is not so nearly dead as croakers will have it. Rumour asserts that Mr. living's next essay will be the part of Sir Giles Overreach.",

                "full_text": "A WARNING AGAINST A PURRLT TECHNICAL EDUCATIOW. FROKSSOR SMITH uttered a salutary warning the other evening against the tendency of the age to be satisfied with a purely techuical education. Coming from a gentleman who himself is devoted to technical education, occupying as he does the chair of engineering at the Mason College, Birmingham, it has all the more value. Technioal education, he thought, was mainly directed towards the improvement of material welfare ..loue. Such an improvement is a good thing in itself, but to set it up as a thing more to be desired that) moral and intellectual elevation is a gross and sensual paganism. Three great and distinct \"\"hjects of study are possible to the child. (1) The thoughts, feelings, aDd modes and motives ai action of past and contemporary generations and for this stujy familiarity with spoken and Written languages was of chief importance (2) natural science in its widest sense, including chtnistry, the mechanics of nature, geology, biology, and so on and (3) the science of art and the practice of art, using the word art to indicate tbe whole result of man's inventive and manipu- lative skill as displayed in manufactures, engi- neering work*, and in architecture, no less than in paintiug, and sculptu re. From the lowest IInd most purely money-making point of view, as weil as from the highest and purest, no measure of success in life is attainable by any man or Woman in whose education any one of these three great classes of study have been wholly ignored, and the success of each must be in tolerably aCCUrate proportion to the degree in which all three had been developed. Any attempt to con- Vert elementary or lower secondary schools into technical schools is strongly to be deprecated; bllt. at the same time, their maintaining their Present narrow and one-sided character is just as much to be deplored. When a. child left them he would,80 far as his training has yet gone, be equally well prepared to enter ou the more specialised education required for employ- ment in any of the great divisions of human work. A persistent attempt is being made just now by many modern educationists to distort the mean- lng of plain language by advocating the establish- ment of such schools, with the literary and the andicraft sides reduced to a minimum, and Imposing to call them technical school.; but if thelle schemes carried the day, the opposition to technical education would grow in force from year \u00b0 year until it became irresistible. Such schools Wre of little or no use in producing industrial skill of any class, from highest to lowest. On the C0^rWy' t'i9^ wou^ he the worst of all schools, P ucing little else than semi-scientific, semi- ignorant priglil, with the narrowest capacity of VII!I\u00b0t1 and judgment.",

A meeting of the council of the University CoJlege of South Wales and Monmouthshire was. holdon Wednesday at Cardiff. Mr Louis TyJor presided, and the others present were Principal \"V iriarau Jones, Mr John Dnncan, Dr. W. T. Edwards, Mr C. T. Whitmell, the Rev. Alfred I Tilly, Professor Vaughan, Dr Treharne, and Mr Ivor James, registrar.\u2014A letter was read from Sir Charles Peel, clerk to the Privy Council, acknowledging the receipt of the draft supple- mental charter of the college, and intimating, that the petition would be submitted to her Majesty at the next meeting of the Council. \u25a0DISTRIBUTION OK PRIZK3. The distribution of prizes will take place on' June 23rd, and not in the autumn, as usual.\u2014The Principal announced that Mr W. Rathbone, M.P., president of the North Wales College, bad kindly accepted the invitation to make the distribution. THE NEW MEDICAL SCHOOL. A letter was read from Dr Haycroft/- the recently-appointed professor of physiology, asking permission to spend on his department the sum of ;8480 for apparatus and J660 for books. The application was granted. Dr Haycroft was present, and the question of the immediate pro- vision necessary for starting the school in October next was fully gone into. Hb presented a rough plan of a proposed extension of the college building by means of a third storey, and the council determined to ask Mr Robinson, the architect under whose supervision a part of the old college was erected, to prepare plans with special reference to economy. The prospectus of the medical school was presented and ordered to be printed and forwarded, with a letter of applica- tion for recognition to the senate of the London University, the secretary, of the conjoint examining board in London, and the Society of Apothecaries. THE WILSH UNIVERSITY. The Registrar presented a copy of the joint petition to the Queen from the three national colleges for the grant of a charter for the proposed Welsh University. He was directed to affix the seal of the college to the petition. THE PRESSURE CN THE COLLEGE. Professor Thompson and Professor Parker both wrote to the council calling attention to the neces- sity for immediate increased accommodation in the departments cf chemistry and biology. Beth professors referred to the increased number of students that may be expected in consequence of the opening of the medical school. Professor Parker stated that at present, even in his inter- mediate class, all the places in his laboratory were taken, and the lecture-room was too small to hold tho junior botany clasa. Additional space was also required in the museum. Iro- fesscr Thompson mentioned that he had con- siderable difficulty in accommodating all the students now working in the chemical laboratory. \u2014The council referred the letters to the senate for consideration and report. THE WOMEN'S DEPARTMENT. Miss Hughes, the head normal mistress, drew attention by letter to the fact that the effective carrying-on of the work in the Women's Train- ing Department would necessitate the appoint- ment of another assistant for next session. Miss Hughes further pointed out that it was possible in the near future the services of an additional assistant would be necessary. The letter was referred to the finance committee for report.\u2014 Miss Hughes having been appointed by the Gilchrist trustees to visit the Chicago Exhibition and report upon the educational side, was granted leave of absence to enable her to pro- ceed to America in May. THE HIGHER TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT. On the recommendation of the joint college and associated counties committee it was de- termined to purchase forthwith electrical, engineering and lightingapparatus, together with a boiler and engine, at an estimated ocst of \u00a3 1,025.\u2014At the instance of Mr Whitmell, it was decided that a card catalogue should be provided for the general library.",

U.S., at present residing at Stannington, near Sheffield, writes as follows :\u2014\" Will you favour me with a little of your space to enter a complaint on account of the singular way in which a paper of mine has been treated by the authorities of the British Association ? I sent to Mr Gordon the paper in question on July 14th, in view of a public an- nouncement that papers would be passed upon beforehand. A month later I wrote to ask why I did not hear about my paper, and got the reply that the committee will not meet until the 25th, it will therefore be quite impossible to say before that date if the paper will be accepted.\" This was so plain a violation of the public promise on which I had depended that I at once asked for the return of my paper. In answer, Mr Gordon wrote to say that his clerk had sent me a wrong state- ment, and that the real facts were that my paper had been referred to a gentleman having special knowledge of the subject of which it treats,\" and that at the next meeting of the committee, August 25th, at Swansea, the referee will there make his report on your paper.\" At Swansea I waited to the second; day, and not gettiug an answer to my request for a report wrote to Mr Gordon, and got the reply, Your paper has been sent to Section D.\" It is a rule of the order of business that papers which have been reported on favourably by the organising committees shall not be brought before the sec- tional committes.\" I was thus entitled to assume that my paper had been reported on favourably, and I remained to read it at the pleasure of the sectional committee. I wrote on Friday to the secretary of Section D to ask for information, and to have my manuscript sent to me to look over before I should be called on to read it. No reply was vouchsafed. On Monday I wrote a second time, and at eleven the next corning still had no reply. An inquiry was then made of one of the secretaries at the meeting of Section D, and the information obtained that the paper had been re- turne I to Mr Gordon, that it wat the custom not to return papers until the close 0;\u00a3 the meeting, and that I had been treated with unusual courtesy in having my paper returned any earlier than that. Later in the day, that is Tuesday afternoon, I received my paper with the following note, signed by one of the secretaries of Section D. \"I am directed by the committee to return to you the accompanying M.S. with thanks. In their opinion the subject of the essay is treated in a manner which is hardly suited to the section to which it referred.\" There is not a shado v of truth in this statement. The section (D) is biology, and my paper is on The causes of life, structure, and species.\" A paper more strictly suited to the section could not have been submitted. But it was not of my doing that it was sent to Section D, and kept there to the end of the week of meetings; and to have it now returned into my hands with this false plea, and with the intima- tion that I get it now by 'unusual courtesy,' seems to call for explanation.\"",

                "full_text": "THE QUEEN'S JUBILEE. A MOST important correspondence between the Prince of WALES and the Lord Mayor of LoNDON has just been published. Its subject is the commemoration of the jubilee of her MAJESTY'S reign. It has for many months been understood that something would be done in celebration of that event, but nothing definite had been agreed upon as to the form which the celebration should assume. Now that we are drawing near the time when active measures must be adopted, the Prince of WALES has taken the initiative, and the Lord Mayor of LONDON has very warmly expressed his concurrence in the proposal. Very probably the suggestion of his Royal High ness will be generally approved of, and steps will immediately be taken to give it effect. The PRINCE advises the formation of an institute which should represent the arts, manufactures, and commerce of the QUEEN'S Colonial and Indian Empire. We presume that Great Britain and Ireland will not be omitted. No doubt the Indian and Colonial Exhibition has had a decided success, but England is England still, and it would not be amiss to show how far the homely islands on which those who live nearest her MAJESTY dwell have progressed in the arts, manufactures, and commerce. We have no objection to offer to the pro- posal so far as it goes, but we hope that science will not be excluded. It would not be much of an exaggeration to allege that most of the physical sciences date from about the year of the QUEEN'S coronation. We are, it is needless to add, speaking only in very general terms, and we are also far from wishing to be understood as entertaining any idea of a direct connection between the two events. The late PRINCE CONSORT did a great deal to promote the study of science, and perhaps his influence may have had some weight, but all that we insist upon is that, as a matter of fact, such sciences as chemistry, biology, geology, and, in many respects, physics have flourished as a new creation during her MAJESTY'S fifty years of sovereignty. The Prince of WALES seems to aim at something exclusively imperial. He thinks of nothing but the Colonies and India. So far we regard his proposal as a mistake and a blunder. We maintain that the greatness and prosperity of England are, to a large extent independent of her Colonial possessions. There is something in old England itself to be proud of, and we are old fashioned enough to put our own country in the first place. The QUEEN has been Empress of INDIA for only a few years, but she has ruled over these homely islands for half a century. We offer no opposition whatever to the sugges- tion made by his Royal Highness. It will probably be warmly taken up, and will prove a grand success. But we venture to object to a proposal which, if based on too narrow a ground, will only stimulate emi- gration. We hear too much in these days about emigration. We are not anxieus to get rid as fast as possible of all our best countrymen\u2014the noble sous of toil\u2014and to have only the paupers, the idlers, and the landlords left behind. We should like to see the soil of our own country set free, and probably nothing could so well commemorate the jubilee of the QUEE as a good Land Act. We strongly deprecate this cry for emigra- tion. If land be made easier of access to the people, and especially to the tiller of the soil, there will be no pressing demand for some time to come for emigration. A great deal of the emigration of the past is due to a condition of things which should long ere this have been brought to an end. We hope, therefore, that the PRINCE'S suggestion will be improved upon.",

DINNER AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE The students and professors of tbe University College of Wales, Aberystwith, celebrated St. David's Day by dining together in the assembly- roums of the Queen's Hotel, the temporary home of the college. The chair was taken by the Rev T. C. Edwards, principal. Cardiff College was not represented, but Mr Philip\", lecturer in biology, represented Bangor. There wae a large number of old students present. During the evening fraternal greetings were wired and re- ceived from Welshmen celebrating St David's Day in different parts of the kingdom.\u2014 Proposing the toast of Her Majesty,\" the Principal, referring to the jubilee year, said whatever might be said about an Imperial Institute, her Majesty might cele- brate ber jubilee by making the endowment of Aberystwith College permanent, and in the second place, and not before, she could establish a Welsh university to join the three national colleges together, and call it the Jubilee University. (Applause.) The Principal also proposed The Memory of St. David,\" observing that our national saint was but a memory, but that was really his glory, for every nation that has a future will have also a past. if it has not an actual past it must create one. It will form a mythology, and from that mythology it will derive power to create a great and durable future. St. David and his fellow saints con stiitute our mythology. The national my- thology of Wales is a world of saints, and we take this to be a good omen, thuo the future of Wales will be intellectual and Christian. TheRevJ. Roberts, Wavfrton. proposed \"The Council and Governors of the CoJ]ee,\" and Professor Brough. The Sister Colleges of Cardiff and Bangor.\"\u2014Proiessor Phi Hips, Baugor, responding, referred to the possibility ot forming a Welsh university, aud reuiaiked that he hoped the time would s\"\u00aba come when they would bnd the three colleges of Wales united iu friendship, love and truth, a motto he saw ou the walls, and granting degrees to its alumni. When tbat time came he was sure the two colleges of Cardiff and Bangor would be perfectly prepared to give to the college at Aber- ystwith all that the laws of primogeniture aeinanded. He was sure, they could hope no better for Cardiff and Bangor than that they would be held in tbe hearts of the Welsh people in the same way &$I was held the college at Aberystwith. (Applause.) The Principal an- nounced that Bangor and Carnarvon had showed I tbpir sympat hv with Aberystwith by subscribing \u00a350 and \u00a3133 towards tbe restoration of Aberystwith College buildings.\u2014The Rev. J. G. Duvies (Aberystwitn) proposed the health of The Principal and Professors,\" anJ tbe tcuist wae acknowledged by Principal Edwards and Professor Genese.\u2014Professor Angns proposed the toast of \"Tbe Old Students,\" which Mr David Samuel acknowledged.\u2014Other toasts were pro- posed and responded to by Messrs Jnhn Evans, J. E. Hughes, A. H. Humphreys (Bangor), J. Y. Evans, Pr. L. 1. Ttiorr.e, and E. H. Dawe.",

This promises to be one of the most charming works of the kind. The style is delightful. The author carries the reader with him over every inch of ground, and all but makes him see with his own eyes what is described. The allusions to Scripture are very happy. The illustrations are excellent, and the map gives us the results of recent surveys, so that it is exceptionally full, accurate, and reliable. The work is to be com- pleted in about thirty part We would advise all who feel interested in the Holy Land and the Bible to become purchasers. It will cost them only sevenpence a month. Having referred to a new serial which the enterprising firm of Cassell and Co. is bringing out we may call attention to the present nurnoo bers of their \"Natural History,\" edited by Dr P. M. Duncan, Professor of Geology in K ug's College, London, Its illustrations of the sponges, the foraminifera, and animalcul\u00bb generally are well worthy of examination. The work on Natural History taken as a whole is a splendid sample of wbat tbe enterprising publishing house of Cassell and Co. can produce. Students must not imagine that because it is cheap it is beneatb their notice. We iShould be glad to know for certain that the majority of students studying biology at our Welsh Colleges could pass a good examination in what these publications contain. We have to acknowledge the receipt of Cassell's \"Family Magazine,\" the\" World of Wonders,\" and Little Folks,\"each commendabl\u00ab in its way. THE SCOTTISH REVIEW October, 1889. London and Paisley Alexander Gardner. We have already noticed in our editorial columns the very able article contributed to this number by Lord Bute, but there are other articles which Scotchmen particularly cannot fail to appreciate. The \"Scotch Farm Labourer,\" by Alexander Gordon, is a life-like picture of what may be seen every day beyond the Tay. South of that, tho farm labourer is, generally speaking, better boused. Darwinism and the Origin of Reason,\" by T. B. Saunders, M.A., is an able and thoughtful critique, which the writer winds up by remarking that zoology has taught us how small is the structural difference between man and his alleged Simian ancestors and psychologists have made clear in what his mental superiority consists. We know where we are, and what it is exactly, which has not yet been explained. A contribution on Byzantine Ecclesiastical Masic\" will be enjoyed by the skilled musician, but the mere novice will be re- pelled. \"Florence WilsoD,\" by Sheriff Rampini, and The Blind Deaf Mute, Helen Keller,\" by J. Clark Murray, LL.D., appeal to all. This review is certainly one of the most enjoyable and instructive contributions to the fleeting modern literature.",

Nioolai, professor in I physiology at the University of Berlin, has been condemned to five months' imprisonment for publishing in Swit- I zerland a book entitled \"Die Biologic des Krieges\" (The Biology of War), in which he deals drastically with the say- ings and doings of his countrymen. This is what he says of Germany's dis- regard for international agreements I When in -1839#he \"perpetual neu- trality\" of Belgium was proclaimed Germany and France rendered war against each other more difficult, and they knew from that day forth that I at the frontier of this neutral State there stood an insurmountable wall, based upon thoir own word. When in 1856 the Declaration of Paris laid it down that captured ships must be brought before a properly con- stituted court, the nations placed a prohibition on the secret sinking of ships. When in 1899 the Hague Conven- tion forbadetlie employment of suffo- cating or poisonous gases, the nations voluntarily deprived themselves of one of the most serviceable implements of warfare, which technical progress pro- mised to render every day more effec- tive. Whatever one may think of the value and significance of such conven- tions\u2014after they are concluded all dis- cussion of them must cease, for hence- forth any breach of them not only damages the enemy, but inflicts irre- parable injury on one's own honour. Therefore there has been nothing so melancholy in this war as the violation of Belgian neutrality, the \"U\" boat campaign, and the use of suffocating gases. For these things are fatal, not only to human life, but to human honour. Reports from the Eastern theatre ef war of the use of disease germs by the Germans receives confirmation 11 he following statements :\u2014 A short time ago one of our mo:t highly cultivated soldiers (who n.iil remain unnamed, on account of his great services.) asked me if it would not be jxissible to throw bombs filled with cholera germs or plague bacilli behind the enemy front. When 1 replied that this seemed neither a profitable nor a very humane: proceeding, he replied with a con- temptuous gesture, \"What have we to do with humanity in this war? Ger- many has a right to do whatever she- pleases. And millions, unhappily, think with; this eminent personage. Thus, Staff-surgeon H. told me in Gmu- dentz that \"He had often wondered whether he could not make his way into Russia in order to innotulate the Russians with living bacteria. Against- suoh a pack everything was permis- sible.\" Such degenerates no longer see ) in the enemy their fellow creatures. Or, rather, they see in them precisely their fellow-creatures, for they see in them beasts. Hato has become a. religion.",

In the unavoidable absence of Prinoipal Reichel, Mr. Howard Lewis occupied the ohair. Tho subject of the lecture was \"Oyster oulture.\" After re- ferring to the great esteem in which the oyster had been held from early times, the lecturer pro- ceeded to describe its structure, development, and the fixation of the spat. He pointed out that the culture of the oyster was necessitated not only on account of reckless depredations which had been made, and were in some cases still being made, on natural oyster grounds, but also on account of the demand for the incessant supply. He drew attention to the fact that it was a pro- fessor of biology who saved by his exertions the oyster industry in France when it was on the high road to ruin. Yet even now the ordinary \"practical\" fisherman presumed to ask what there was for the man of science to teach him. At Conway another object-lesson presented itself, but it would take time to rub such lessons in. The lecturer then traced the gradual rise of oyster culture from ancient to modern times, describing in some detail the symptoms in vogue in the chief oyster-producing countries. From all that he had seen and read he was not hopeful that the artificial system of raising young oysters could ever be carried out in this country with the success it met with in such places as Arcachou, in France. Climatic conditions in this country were not always favourable. One year there might be a good deposition of spat, in another practically none. He drew attention to the chief places in England where attempts in this direction had been made, and referred to the experiments carried out by Mr. J. T. Cunningham in Corn- wall. He hoped that they would ultimately lead to oyster-rearing on a commercial scale. Last year Mr. James Lawson, of Liverpool, mnde a gift of \u00a315 to the college for experiments in oyster culture in the Menai Straits. Two largo crates filled with tiles on the one hand and slates on the other were set down in the estuary of the Ogwen-a natural oyster ground-but he re- gretted to say that there was a poor fall of spat last year, and the experiment was not successful. The experiment, however, would be repeated this year, and with the B20 recently allocated to him by the Lancashire and Western Sea Fisheries Committee he intended to carry it out on a larger scale. The lecture was illustrated through- out by lantern slides and with specimens, and was listened to with much interest.",

THE HOME Rru: MOVEMENT IN IRELAND.\u2014A meeting was held in Poyntzpass. in the county of Armagh, on Saturday, to oppose the Home Rule move- ment. Thirty-three Orange lodges and a number of sympathisers attended. A resolution was passed, declar- ing that any grievances of which the country might have to complain would be best remedied by the Imperial Parli[1,ment, and that a revival of the Irish Parliament would obstruct the progress of civil and religious liberty, ami be injurious to the social awl commercial interests of the country. One of the speakers observed that if the Home Hule movement succeeded, the next demand would be to get back from their present owners the lands which belonged to the old Irish clans, and the Orangemen, if they joined, would only be made tools of to effect that object.

Scott, farmer, Stapeley Hall, Nantwich, was charged with not notifying the police of the existence of sheep scab on his premises. It was stated defendant admitted knowing that some of his sheep were affected, but he thought he could cure them himself and did not report the disease until Some days afterwards. Defendant denied saying this, and the case was dismissed, the Bench considering the evidenca was not sufficiently strong. NATURAL SCIENCE SOCIETY.\u2014Mr. J. Bairatow gavo an able paper on \"Electrons\" at the Museum, Chester, on Thursday. He led up to Professor Ramsay's suggestion that the electron was just as much an element as waa oxygen or hydrogen, chlorine, or carbon. Ho went even further than this, and asked them to oonsider whether in the light of recent know- ledge they could any longer think of metals like sodium and zinc for example as anything eloo than compounds, compounds of was and electrons. Electrons were creating a ferment in minds of natural philosophers. In every de. partment of science the influence of the electron was a'tering and remodelling our ideas about light, space, timo and matter, leading to a truo conception of nature and her ways, and the gigantic forces which have moulded the world to its present form. In biology it had given new stimulus to the enquiry into the most pro- found of all mysteries- the problem of the origin of life. The geologist no longer looked upon the evolution of the globe aa a series of cataclysms and catastrophies of plutonic activity; these he regarded as paesing incidents of continuously shifting scene. Like the physicist, he looked for an cxp'anation and answer, not in the wliilrwind and earthquake, but in the still small voice, and found that the process of moulding the universe was due rather to the continuous and irresistible action of sub-atomio powers. In the discovery of sub-atomic powers nature had been taken by surprise, and had given up one of her most closely guarded secrete. As a consequence man stood face to face with the point and origin of the outpourings of nature, by virtue of which the universe to-day was a going concern, and not a collection of cold, lifeless, and extinct worlds. The light W6 h.ad gained could be regarded only as a benevo- lent hint into the secrets whioh otherwise might not have been solved. However we regarded it, the fact remained that in every department of life men have taken the hint, and were pur- suing with unsurpassing eagerness this revela- tion of apparently inexhaustible energy.

Flavius Josephus Cook, Congregationaiist minister. He was the author of several powerful works, among others being Transcendentalism.\" Biology,\" and Labour.\" In his time Cook influenced a good deal of the re- ligious thought of Boston and other cities in America. He visited many countries. and delivered lectures wherever he went. About 20 vears ago he paid a visit to Wales, and indeed came so near as Tre- orchy, where he delivered (at. Bethania Chapel) a lecture, entitled Does Death end AU r\" The chapel was crowded on the occasion, some of those present having come so far as from Pontypridd to hear him. The chairman that night was the Rev. W. Lewis, R.D. Vicar of Ystrady- fodNArg. Mr. W. E. Jenkins, the Cwmparc librarian, who was present at the lecture, says it was a masterly and a most pro found discourse. Cook was a, big and robust man, more like a country farmer than a, student of metaphysics. As a citizen, as well as a minister, he took great interest in other domains than re- ligion. He deplored some years ago the want of the spirit of the -old Pilgrim Fathers, that the people did not arouse themselves to execute legislation like that of the old law of 1070, a law intended to rescue the country from the barbarism of an uneducated population. When Presi- dent Grant recommended that there should be a reading test in the national vote, Cook strongly supported it. He was the sworn enemy of the drink traffic and de- voted much time and energy to undermine its gigantic power. Here is an extract: There are eight miles of legalised grog- shops in Boston. Take the licensed dram- shops of Boston, allow each one 20 feet of front, put them in a line and you have 8 miles of manufactories of madmen and paupers.\" Cook rendered effective assist- ance to the ladies who united in asking for the vote for women in regard to the temperance laws. He did what he could also in raising the labourer from the dung- hill by agitating for a higher wage for him. Socialists and Communists, how ever, he regarded as social heretics. A friend of the employed, yet he was not a foe to the capitalists. He would not countenance strikes, and referred to a strike at, Merthyr many years ago in which the workmen claimed a minimum wage but found it then impossible to get. Many other instructive topics could be touched upon, but, enough has been said, perlians, to give a definite idea of the man. His influence has partially disappeared says the British Weekly,\" and his books seem to have had their day.",

Grant (, ec^ntly returned from the Arctic Regions) iias given n lecture on \"Tiie Claims of Science on further Arctic Exploration.\" Atr. 11. L Le Fcvre, C-L., president of the society, occupied the chair.\u2014 '.1 hI'; Lecturer said tnat the last expedition which left our shori^j in 1,0 for the purpose of Arctic dis- covery and investigation was a generous and mngni- liceut, though perhaps somewhat tardy, tribute to tee memory of that gallant company of Artie heroes w 00 perished in the attempt to solve the Polar problem. Unfortunately it did not succeed in solving i oat problem, but it brought, back another which also awaited solution-viz., AVtiat was the cause of its vetnt of success H\" did not, however, wish to stir q) the ernoers of a discussion which had for the pri-ent been closed. He believed there did not exist o: e individual embodied with the smallest modicum ot Arctic ardour and enthusiasm who did not wish Liley might have the opportunity of plant- ing the iJrithh ensign 011 that particular spot of eartti called the Morth Pole. In meteorology, terrestrial magnetism, biology, geology, and glacial poysics, ant in ail atmospheric phenomena, the s \u25a0 entiuc results r.f such an expedition, if successful, wouid be beyond all doubt immense: and it had been recently stated by one or our most learned and practical physicists, \"that until we are thoroughly acquainted itii the meteorology of the Arctic re- gems, meteeroiogy is deprived of its most important tactor. In the vast area of the Arctic regions, winch was gradually being dug into and explored, Li rtt was a bouudless store ot wealth for the scien- tist, and, through him, tor the whole world; and as 1, ng as Arctic exploration continued, and as long as tiie scientific results of the various expeditions were worked out and made known, some good at any rate must result from these voyages which so many per- sons deemed a waste of time and energy, and quite undeserving of the risk of life and expenditure of material which they involved. In times long gone in marvellous results were always expected from v r yag.s to the North. Baron Nordenskjold still b, i, that a passage might be made in safety to Cotna and the West Coast of North America by following in his steps along the northern shores of Siberia. Had that explorer's Arctic expeditions, he Halved, borne no fruit He asserted that, apart from the scientific results of his voyage, which were as numerous as they were useful and interesting, he had developed a fresh held for commerce, and had opened out a trade by sea with one of the richest and most productive countries in the world\u2014viz., Siberia. Or course, as yet this trade was in its infancy, though there was, no doubt, much to be done in that direction. As to the part balloonists might take in future expeditions to the North Pole, he expressed an opinion that it would seem almost impossible for a balloon, however skilfully managed, to leave a shioonan aerial voyage through cold and desolate regions for some 3U0 to ;)00 miles, and then to return to the same spot with safety.",

                "full_text": "THE claims OF SCIENCE ON FURTHER I ARCTIC EXPLORATION. At a meeting of the Balloon Soeiety of Great Dri tain, held at the Aquarium, London, Mr. W. G. A. Grant (recently returned from the Arctic Regions) has given a lecture on The Claims of Science on Further Arctic Exploration.\" Mr. H. L. La Fevre, C.E., president of the society, occupied the chair. The Lecturer said that the last expedition which lefl our shores in 1876 for the purpose of Arctic dis- covery and investigation was a generous and magni- ficent, though perhaps somewhat tardy, tribute te the memory of that gallant company of Artic heroes who perished in the attempt to solve the Polar problem. Unfortunately it did not succeed in solvijjg that problem, but it brought back another which also awaited solution\u2014viz., What was the cause of its want of success ? He did not, however, wish to stir up the embers of a discussion which had for the present been closed. He believed there did not exist one individual embodied with the smallest modicum of Arctic ardour and enthusiasm who did not wish they might have the opportunity of plant- ing the British ensign on that particular spot of earth called the North PIiIM. In meteorology, terrestrial magnetism, biology, geology, and glacial physics, and in all atmospheric phenomena, the scientific results of such an expedition, if successful, would be beyond all doubt immense; and it had been recently stated by one of our most learned &ad practical physicists, that until we are thoroughly acquainted with the meteorology of the Arctic re- gions, meteorology is deprived of its most important factor.\" In the vast area of the Arctic regions, which was gradually being dug into and explored, th\u00abre was a boundless store of wealth for the scien- tist, and, through him, for the whole world; and as lung as Arctic exploration continued, and as long as the scientific results of the various expeditions were worked out and made known, some good at any rate must result from these voyages which so many per- sons deemed a waste of time and energy, and quite undeserving of the risk of life and expenditure of material which they involved. In times long gone by marvellous results were always expected from voyages to the North. Baron Nordenskjold still believed that a passage might be made in safety te China and the West Coast of North America by following in his steps along the northern shores of Siberia. Had that explorer's Arctic expeditions, he asked, borne no fruit ? He asserted that, apart from the scientific results of his voyage, which were as numerous as they were useful and interesting, he had developed a fresh ield for commerce, and had opened out a trade by sea with one of the richest and most productive countries in the world\u2014viz., Siberia. Of course, as yet this trade was in its infancy, though there was, no doubt, much to be done in that direction. As to the part balloonists might take in future expeditions to the North Pole, he expressed an opinion that it would seem -almost impossible for a balloon, however skilfully managed, to leave a ship on an aerial voyage through cold and desolate regions for some 300 to 500 miles, and then to return to the same spot with safety.",

                "full_text": "CARDIFF UNIVERSITY COLLEGE AND TECHNICAL SCHOOLS. THE NEW BUILDINGS. Accompanying the description here set forth, we present to our readers blocks of the Cardiff new technical schools buildings which it is proposed to erect in Newport-road. It will be remembered that some time ago the Corporation of Cardiff and the governors of the University College were in treaty for the transference of the technical schools rothe college, the object being titat one building might servo the purposes of both authorities, and that, whilst it was put to the service of the college by day, it might be occupied by the students of the science and art Jepartraeut and the technical schools in the evenings. The negotia- i ions were satisfactorily concluded, and that being accomplished, Mr. J. P. Jones, architect. Park- street, was instructed to prepare plans for the building, which lie has done in a very praise- worthy manner. Only the central block shown in the elovation fronting Newport-road, together wiib the engineering school, is at present proposed to be built. That building wi!l extend due north and south, back to the Paw aJe. a depth of some- tiling like 300ft. It will be occupied entirely by the technical schools in the evening as aforesaid, and during the day college classes in biology, chemistry, physics, &c\u201e will be held. The engineer- ing depigment will be a practical engineer. 's school with workshops and lecture-rooms. The building is in the Tudor style of architecture, and the central block, including the basement, con. tains six storeys, without taking into consideration the tower. The front will be elaborated with statues of various personages who have made their mark in Welsh literature and science. In the rear ALTERNATIVE DESIGN FOR CENTBAt BLOCK. i i there will be four storeys. On the ground floor and basement are lecture-rooms, which will be devoted mainly to the physical department The first floor will be utilised for the teaching of chemistry, and lecture-rooms and laboratories will be fitted up. The upper storeys will be ueed for lecture-rooms. The block facing the Parade will have in the basement dining-rooms for male and female students, together with a cookery school. The ground, first, and second floors will be utilised for a school of art, including modelling, drawing from the antique, freehand, &c. The fourth storey will be used as a biological department. The length of the building is 310ft., and the width of tbe technical schools 45ft. The Schgol of Art frontage is 113ft., and the central block in Newport-road 5Stt. Tbe spire in the central block will be 140ft, high. Ilis engineering school will be erected on the west side of the main block, adjoining the road up to the Rhymney Railway, and will be 2301t. long, with an average width of 53fl. Its front there will be a lecture-room and drawing- office, which will necessitate two storeys, facing Newpoit-road, but the rest of the building will only be of one storey. It is ultimately Intended to extend the buildings as far as West-grove in an easterly direction, and to take in the site of the present college in a westerly direction. The build- ings will also reach back from Newport- road to the Parade. That, however, is not con- templated fit present, and the wings on either side of the central block will not be erected for some time. They will contain chiefly the administra- tive department on the ground floor. On the west eide on the first floor will be a largt, college-hall, and on the east side a library. These, of course, are shown in the plan, but their erection will betiolayed until after tbe completion of the central block. The estimated cost of the central block is \u00a3 30,000, and of the engineering school about \u00a3 5,000.",

                "full_text": "OYSTER CULTURE IN NORTH WALES I Professor White, of the University College of North Wales, Bangor, who has been delivering a course of lectures during the winter and spring at tno various centres in Carnarvonshire, de- livered the twelfth and last of the series at the University College, Bangor, on Friday. In the unavoidable absence of Principal Reichel, Mr. Howard Lewis occupied the chair. The subject of the lecture was \"Oyster culture.\" After re- ferring to the great esteem in which the oyster had been held from early times, the lecturer pro- ceeded to describe its structure, development, and the fixation of the spat. He pointed out that the culture of the oyster was necessitated not only on account of reckless depredations whioh had been made, and were in some cases still being made, on natural oyster grounds, but also on account of the demand for the incessant supply. He drew attention to the fact that it was a pro- fessor of biology who saved by his exertions the oyster industry in France when it was on the high road to ruin. Yet even now the ordinary \"practical\" fisherman presumed to ask what there was for the man of science to teach him. At Conway another object-lesson presented itseii, but it would take time to rub such lessons in. The lecturer then traced the gradual rise of oyster culture from ancient to modern times, describing in some detail the symptoms in vogue in the chief oyster-producing countries. From all that he had seen and read he was not hopeful that the artificial system of raising young oysters could ever be carried out in this country with the success it met with in such places as Arcachon, in France. Climatic conditions in this country were not always favourable. One year there might be a good deposition of spat, in another practically none. He drew attention to the chief places in England where attempts in this direction had been made, and referred to the experiments carried out by Mr. J. T. Cunningham in Corn- wall. He hoped that they would ultimately lead to oyster-rearing on a commercial scale. Last year Mr. James Lawson, of Liverpool, made a gift of \u00a3 15 to the college for experiments in oyster culture in the Menai Straits. Two large orates filled with tiles on the one hand and slates on the other were set down in the estuary of the Ogwen-a natural oyster ground-but he re- gretted to say that there was a poor fall of spat last year, and the experiment was not successful. The experiment, however, would be repeated this year, and with the J620 recently allocated to him by the Lancashire and Western Sea Fisheries Committee he intended to carry it out on a larger scale. The lecture was illustrated through- out by lantern slides and with specimens, and was listened to with much interest.",

                "full_text": "ABOUT HOBBIES. Whilst there are people not a few who declare that the nation is running too much after sport and play, we belike it to be equally true that quite as much dansrer hangs over the man who suffers from what Herbert Spencer called \"work. drunkenness.\" There are many species of drunkenness, and this is not the least harmful of the series. Business and pro- fessional1 men suifer far more from it than do the masses. With the latter the intense yearning for fire p.m. and for one o'clock on Saturdays is a far too prevalent symptom, betokening, as it does, that those so afflicted work not for work's sake, and so fail to take that pride in what they do without which they can never excel. But to go from this extreme to the other we have, as we said, to get among business and professional men, and here we find \"work-drunkenness\" ram- pant. How many men there are who seem to get no enjoyment whatever save in their business hours, who think only of their ledgers and their profits, and whose only talk in their leisure time is \"shop.\" These men may be surrounded with every luxury, the hard-earned fruit of their toil; but it is their wives and families who rejip the benefit, and the unhappy \"work-drunkard\" either dies in his shoes\" or \"retires\" to spend a few remaining years in an atmosphere of vain regret that he can no longer indulge in his daily debauch of business. We have spoken of Herbert Spencer, but even this great philosopher was not wholly exempt. At all events, his leisure hours afforded him scant enjoy- ment. And why? The answer applies not merely to the philosopher but to every member of the class to whom we have been alluding. These people have no hobby. Herbert Spencer had none, though be seems to have loved music. Here, then, we have the community I divided into two classes, those who live for amusement and those who have no amusement for which to live. The latter are in every whit as evil case as the former, and to all who suffer from this complaint the best advice that can be given is to cultivate a hobby. These are times when hobbies can be cultivated far more favourably than in the days gone by. Science and art afford manifold means of recreation, and then there are many other forms of amusement, such as golf, cricket, fishing, hunting, and every other type of sport, the cultivation of flowers, and goodness knows what beside. Every man has something in his nature to which recrea- tion in one form or other appeals, and when a hobby is taken up the faculties onoe neglected are brought into play, and the man begins to feel that he works all the better for the change, that he is a more useful man, and very likely happier and more agreeable to boot. Let anyone study the pages of HWho's Who,\" and note bow many of our repre- sentative men are wise enough to adopt this line:-Asquith, golf; Balfour, golf and motoring; Lord Cromer, shooting, fishing; Sir C. Dilke, fencing, rowing, sculling, riding; Lord Grenfell, cycling; Keir Hardie, reading, gardening; Sir William Huggins, curio collecting, music, botany, fishing; Sir H. Johnston, paint- ing, biology, music; Sir T. Lipton, yacht- ing Dr. Macnamara, golf, fishing; Pier- pont Morgan, dog fancying and yacht- ing President Roosevelt, ranching, hunting, and natural history. But why prolong the list? Would such men as these be half what they are without their various hobbies ?",

                "full_text": "ABOUT HOBBIES. Whilst there are people not a few who declare that the nation is running too mnch after sport and play, we believe it to be equally true that quite as much danger hangs over the man who suffers from what Herbert Spencer called \"work- drunkenness.\" There are many species of drunkenness, and this is not the least harmful of the series. Business and pro- fessional men suffer far more from it than do the masses. With the latter the intense yearning for five p.m. and for one o'clock on Saturdays is a far too prevalent symptom, betokening, as it does, that those so afHicted work not for work's sake, and so fail to take that pride in what they do without which they can never excel. But to go from this extreme to the other we have, as we said, to get among business and professional men, and here we find\" work-drunkenness ram- pant. How many men there are who seem to get no enjoyment whatever save in their business hours, who think only of their ledgers and their profits, and whose only talk in their leisure time is \"shop.\" These men may be surrounded with every luxury, the hard-earned fruit of their toil; but it is their wives and families who reap the benefit, and the unhappy \"work-drunkard\" either \"dies in his Shoes\" or \"retires\" to spend a few remaining years in an atmosphere of vain regret that he can no longer indulge in his daily debauch of business. We have spoken of Herbert Spencer, but even this great philosopher was not holly exempt. At all events, his leisure hours afforded him scant enjoy- ment. And why? The answer applies not merely to the philosopher but to every member of the class to whom we have been alluding. These people have no hobby. Herbert Spencer had none, though he seems to have loved music. Here, then, we have the community divided into two classes, those who live for amusement and those who have no amusement for which to live. The latter are in every whit as evil case as the former, and to all who suffer from this complaint the best advice that can be given is to cultivate a hobby. These are times when hobbies can be cultivated far more favourably than in the days gone by. Science and art, afford manifold means of recreation, and then there are many other forms of amusement, such as golf, cricket, fishing, hunting, and every other type of sport, the cultivation of flowers, and goodness knows what beside. Every man has something in his nature to which recrea- tion in one form or other appeals, and when a hobby is taken up the faculties once neglected are brought into play, and the man begins to feel that he works all the better for the change, that he is a more useful man, and very likely happier and more agreeable to boot. Let anyone study the pages of \"Who's Who, and note how many of our repre- sentative men are wise enough to adopt this line:-Asquith, golf; Balfour, golf and motoring; Lord Cromer, shooting, fishing; Sir C. Dilke, fencing, rowing, sculling, riding; Lord Grenfell, cycling; Keir Hardie, reading, gardening; Sir William Huggins, curio collecting, music, botany, fishing; Sir II. Johnston, paint- ing, biology, music; Sir T. Lipton, yacht- ing Dr. Alacnamara, golf, fishing; Pier- pont Morgan, dog fancying and yacht- ing; President Roosevelt, ranching, hunting, and natural history. But why prolong the list? Would such men as these be half what they are without their various hobbies?",

The Intematdonail Congress on Mora.1 Educa- tion finished its discussions on Tuesday at the London University, South Kensington. -Mr. Oloudesley Breteton (divisional inspec- tor, London County Council) said that a-11 Moral instruction most presume on the part of the teacher, if not of the taught, some regutaj* dogmatic system. The gradual reve- lation of underlying ideals of conduct should take place very early. Colonel G. M. Onslow and Mr. Eugene Sully (of the National Physical Recreation Society) were the joint a-uthors of a paper on the mora.1 effects of physical training. They eaid tha.t the vthst difference between ga-mea, a-thletica, Ac.. a.nd soietitino physical training waa that in the foa-mer the stimulus came from without, in the letter from within. The British peoptc did not realise this all-impor- tant difference. If they did, they would insist upon every boy and girl, as every prac- tical German did, going to the gymnasium olaas two or three tunes a. weel:. The prac- tice of gymnastics cultivated, encouraged, a.nd promoted temperance, obedience, courage. discipline, and other qualities essential to the ma<king of patriotic citizens. Mr. SujHy, in ampplememting this paper, 6pol:e on the subject of games. He sadd he did not think games made for ujiselnshness. Physical tnadning'. be thought, shouJd be Blade comptdsory, but games should be optioTtaJ. As soon as they made games a business\u2014as most secondary schools did- they became not games, but something eikie. (Cheers.) -Mr. E. J. Boville (New York) spoke of the work of va.oa.tion schools in America.. He Balid they were started because of the perils, phyaical and mor&l, to which elementary school-children were subject during vacation time in great cities. Dr. J. W. Slaughter spoke on \"The Eela- tion of Eugenics to Moral Education.\" He said that the present population of the world wae the orea-tor of all the geNera- tiona to come. Those generations were demanding that their present &6t of ances- tors sh<)uld pass to them the torch of life with its )irht undimmed a,nd, if poaaible, witih a brighter aa-oie. Biology assured them that this could be done under certain con. ditiona. It seemed needful, therefore, that their youth should obtain a knowledge ci those eonditiona and be kept alive to the claims of their unborn children. Tha.t the Western ra-oee were slipping down an inclined pla-ne wa.s no shriek of the oaJajnity- htowler, but a conclusion based on undis- puted f&cts a.nd the known operation of the laws of heredity. UnleM a change took place, a few generationa more would dump us on the rubbish-heap, and leave ooir place to a more vigorous. if more barbarous stock. It was, then, a matter of urgency to educate our voting for parenthood, to provide against the time when, like every race, we must prove our right to existence. Directo!re Gowns and Tight Lacmg. I There was an echo of the \"tight lacm?\" eontroverey in & paper read at the congress by Miss Looker who urged the impoTtamce of tea<;ihing' &na<tc<my ?1 echooJa. If thaA were done EirJs would s<xm. get a,wa.y fr<Hn th\u00f8 nMdepn ideas of faahi-ofn. They would then rea.liae thaA them wae no beauty in cruehitig their bodies. She hOO/rd some girls who were tooikin.? aA the Dtrectou-e gowns at the White City the other da.y say, **0h, how we should love dreesea like thaA.\" Such a w!ah would be imtpottaiMe when once girls grasped the Meo. of the ma/buTal boild of their bodies.",

                "full_text": "Marwolaeth Mr. George Spurrell, Caerfyrddin. Dydd Mawrth, Awst 29ain, bu farw Mr. George Spurrell, Caerfyrddin, yn dra sydyn. Yn yr hwyr, wedi cael ciniaw, aeth yn nghwmni ei fab i weled llif yn yr afon, a thra yn dychwelyd trwy Conduit-lane, syrth- iodd yn erbyn y mur, fel pe mewn llewyg ond wedi ei gario i'w d\u00fd, cafwyd ei fod yn farw. Ganwyd ef yn nhref Caerfyrddin yn 1820, a dilynodd ei dad i amryw swyddi cy- hoeddus pwysig fel clerc. Yr oedd yn glerc i ynadon sir a thref Caerfyrddin ac i Fwrdd Heolydd y Sir ac hefyd i Ddirprwywyr y Trethoedd am y dref heblaw swyddi pwysig ereill. Rhagorai yn ei hyddysgiaeth fanol a phrofiadol o weithrediadau cyfraith y prif- ffyrdd, a chymerid ei gynghor yn ami gan aelodau Seneddol ar y pwnc hwnw ac yr oedd ei ddylanwad i'w weled yn amlwg ar amryw o'r deddfau a basiwyd trwy y Senedd ar y cwestiwn. Yn nghyflawniad ei swydd, eafodd lawer i wneyd mewn cysylltiad a therfysgoedd \"Becca.\" Yr oedd yn Geid- wadwr ac Eglwyswr selog, a theimlai dydd- )rdeb mawr mewn symudiadau llenyddol a gwyddonol. Yr oedd yn hen bleidiwr o gau y tafarndai ar y Saboth; a thrwy ei ymdrech- ion ef, cafodd pleideb ei ddanfon i'r Senedd yn 1857 oddiwrth ynadon trefydd Caer- Eyrddin a Chydweli, yn gofyn am y cyfryw yn dyfod dan sylw y dynion mawr fyddant yn dyfod at eu gilydd yn nghyfarfodydd blyn- yddol y Gymdeithasfa. Cynaliodd y Gym- deithasfa ei chyfarfodydcl eleni yn Southamp- ton. Y cadeirydd am y flwyddyn oedd Dr. Siemens, ac yr oedd ei araeth gyda'r galluocaf a ddarllenasom erioed, ac yn adolygiad ar y cynydd a wnawd yn mhob cangen o wybodaeth yn ystbd y flwyddyn a aeth heibio. Tra- ddodwyd anerchiad rhagorol gan Mr. R. Etheridge, F.R.S., ar Ddaeareg. Ond un o'r rhai mwyaf dyddorol ydoedd anerchiad cam- pus Proffeswr Boyd Dawkins ar Biology, neu wyddor bywyd. Traethai y gwr dysgedig bethau rhyfedd iawn. Dywedai fod cyfnod wedi bod yn yr oesau pell draw, pan yr oedd y porcupine, y llew, y panther, y lynx Affri- canaidd, y gath Caifraraidd, yr hyena ysmot- lyd a brithresedig, a'r cawrfil Affricanaidd i'w cael yn llawn yn ughoedwigoedd Prydain a'r Iwerddon. Ceid yn y wlad hon, hefyd, y behemoth (neu yr hippopotamus), a'r rhino- ceros. Yn wir, nid rhyw lawer o wylltfilod a geir yn awr yn anialwch coediog Affrica nad oeddynt yn Mhrydain filoedd lawer o flynyddau yn ol. Dywedai, hefyd, fod Pry- dain wedi suddo dan y mor er's miloedd o oesau yn ol, a bod mynyddoedd Cymru yr amser hwnw 2,300 troedfedd dan wyneb y m6r. Yr ydys wedi cael y gwirioneddau mawrion a hynod hyn allan trwy ddargan- fyddiadau daearegol a bywydol. Traddodwyd anerchiadau gwir ddyddorol hefyd ar Ddaear- yddiaeth gan Syr R. Temple, ac Mr. P. de Tchihalchef, aelod o golegau gwyddonol Paris, Berlin, Munich, St. Petersburg, &c. Canol- barth Asia oedd testyn y cyntaf, ac anial- diroedd Affrica ac Asia oedd gan yr olaf. Cafwyd yno anerchiad hefyd gan y daear- yddwr Awstriaidd, Chevalier De Hesse Warteg, yr hwn a deithiodd lawer yn Affrica ac America ac anerchiad hefyd ar ddifyneg- iaeth ac anianddysg gan Mr. F. J. Faraday. Carem roddi dyfyniadau o'r anerchiadau uchel ddysgedig ond gwir ddyddorol hyn mewn rhifynau dyfodol, ac os na fydd ein gofod yn rhy brin golygwn wneyd hyny.",

                "full_text": "SWANSEA SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY. A CHEMICAL SECTION. We note with pleasure that an attempt is being made by the Scientific Society to remove any ground for the reproach that is sometimes levelled at it, of want of earnestness in the pursuit of scientific questions, and we hope that the mo v, ment will receive that support from its member s and the public which it deserves. Four sections under the heads of Archseology, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics and Geology have been organised. A rneetiag of the Chemical and Physical Section took place on Monday evening, Col. Morgan presiding, and there were present, Mr. S. Harris, Mr. ,Joseph Owen, Mr. Alex. Mcffat, Mr. C. H. Perkins, Dr. G' A. Stephens, Mr. C. A. Seyler, Mr. Kudoif Su:hsiand, Mr. Wm. Terrill, and Mr. Jas. Brown (The Cam&rian), etc. Mr. C. A. Seyler, the Public Analyst, gave a short address setting forth a programme for the future work ot the Section. In tne course of his remarks Mr. Seyler said it has always seemed to him a matter for wonder that in Swansea, which boasts itself the metallurgical centre of the world, there should exist no society or union of metal- lur.gis;ti and chemists. It should be the task of the Scienitific Society to remove this anomaly. We are very favourably situated in Swansea for I the formation of sucn a Society. Pure and academic science is represented by the Technical School with its staff ot' highly trained teachers practical science by the analytical profession and the numerous works' chemists. In nu branch of science is it possible to stand 8ti:l. Metallurgical processes and products change and necessitate modified analytical methods. Theoretical Chemistry has made immense strides of late years and and an almost new science of Physical Chemistry has arisen in which eleetrical facts play a most prominent part and side by side with it has developed the application of electricity to chemical industry and to an&lys s. I need only mention that the theory of electrolytic dissociation in solution has thrown an entirely new light upon analytical processe-\u2014 esreclally upon those volumetric ones which takes such an important place in commercial analytical work. This theoretical progress has furnished for the first time a theoreiical basis for analytical practice. Much good work remains to be done in the application of the newly-won principles to practical matters. We must recognise that on theoretical grounds the most accurate chemical analysis can only be an approximation to the truth which remains ever aa ideal towards which to strive. Apart from this every chemist and assayer must recognise that the best of analytical processes are not perfect. We all know that such things as differences among analysts will occur even with tne most careful work. These are chiefly due to want of agreemeht between analysts as to their mode of procedure. The details of one and the same method are often variously prac- tised\u2014alternative methods are often useci giving slightly different results. The degree of accuracy which was formerly sufficient is becoming increasingly inadequate in these days of keen competition. New methods arise which require to be compared with the old ones. I need only refer to ttie processes for zinc assay. The old Schaffner process so much used in Swansea has been modified on the Continent, where they laugh at our ferric indicator with what justice is a fit subject for discussion among us. Again the Americans use almost exclusively the ferrocy- anide process which is also adopted by several assayei s and works in the neighbourhood. After further illustrating this point Mr. Seyler contin- ued 1. All these oaodificaations necessarily lead to variations in the results. On the Continent and in America much good work has been done by meetings oi cnemists who ha.ve compared aud investigated the processes in common use and come to some agreement aa to their practice with the object of reducing assayers differences. This work has I think been entirely neglected in this country. Here I suggest is most valuable work for us to do. Let us have a symposium on zinc or copper lead and so tortn in due course and follow the admirable example set to us by other countries.\" Alter discussing the practical details of inaugurating his work, Mr\\ Seyler resumed Here is good work for the Society for years, a standing basis for solid useful work which need not interfere with the discussion ot other inter- esting matters. In the course otchemical practice there are always questions of theoretical and practical interest which occur, inese are seldom followed up, partly perhaps for want of lime, but more often I am convinced fo? want of an organised interest in research. Let our members bring forward these points as they occur even if they do not pretend to solve the proo.ems, it is useful and stimulating to research to have them raised. Chemical questions are now ot almost universal application and interest. Here for instance we are upon the most interesting coal-field in the world, shewing within easy access almost every variation from peat to brown co il through bituminous and steam coal to anthracite. Iu France and Germany the various coals have been systematically examined, and most'interest- ing classifications of them made on chemical basi3. The question has bean raised, how far are these classifications applicable to British coals ? but never to my knowledge satisfactorily answered, though the material for it must to a large extent exist scattered through laboratory note-books. c Here is a good field for work. Are existing classifications applicable to British coais, and if not, what relations exist between the chemical and practical properties of our coals ? I n-ed not dwell upon the close connection between chemistry and ng,neenng science\u2014the chemistry for instance ot iron steel and copper of lubricants wat,r fur boiler purposes, oj: builuitig materials cement, etc., or on the relation of chemistry to medical and sanitary science Biology and Geology\u2014in each and all of these domains there is a wealth of problems within the reach of humble yet useful work, such as mlg-ht be done by our society. In conclusion I appeal to all local chemists, assayers, metallurgists, and work's managers, as well as to the scientific staff of the Technical School, to give us their peisonal support.\" A discussion took place on the best means of organising the section, and of making it known, ani tne meeting was then adjourned to Monday, December 12th, when Mr. Seyler will open the discussion by some remarks on the chemistry of coal. The meetings of the various sections are open to all present or intending members of the Scientific Society. Members can join at any time, the annual subscription being the nominal sum of five shillings.",

                "full_text": "Darwinism and Germany. THE LESSONS OF NATURE. On Friday evening Dr. Lloyd Williams, professor oi botany at the l-liversity Coi.ege of Wales, delivered a lecture before a large audience at the Liberal Club on \"Darwinism and Germany.\" Councillor J. Barclay Jenkins presided. Long before war was declared, said Dr. Williams, German writers justified and even glorified war as a supreme virtue by appeals to the teaching of biology and evpecial.y to the teachings of Darwin. All nature being one and the basic principles the same throughout all life, much can be learnt about the social relations of human beings by reference to the lower animals and to vegetable life. But it is easy to apply these principles too rigidity and forget that the higher we get in the scale the greater is the number of factors which affect the problem, and that many new conditions come in to modify the problem. It is nothing new to find rhat Germany, in spite of her cleverness, can also be in- tensely stupid and commit appalling blunders; and in attempting to prove that Darwinism supports war and German methods Germany has grotesquely misin- terpreted Darwin. Darwin, after years of patient research, came to the conclusion that there is in nature a struggle for exist- ence resulting in natural selection, more varied and better forms, and a survival of the fittest. In applying Darwin's teaching Germany concluded that there is an in- tense struggle between states, that only the fittest will survive, that fitness means power measured in strength and size, and particularly in ability to fight other states. Hence the greatest of German virtues is courage, the will to power, glori- fying the iea of rude strength in his term super-man. claiming that the German is the super-man. But that is a fallacy. Mere strength or brute force does not necessarily mean fitness. Monster animals of. the past in size and strength had be- come extinct, proving that they were not the fittest to survive, while smaller forms of life survived. Nietsche carried the German conception to its logical extreme in declaring that mercy and sympathy and philanthropy are against nature and put, limits to the strugge and defeat the pro- cess of natural selection. But the feel- ings of sympathy, and even of self-sacri- fice occur in lower nature. Barnhardi argued that courage is a virtue, that war breeds courage, and that therefore war j a fruitful garden of physical and moral flowers. But courage and heroism are not the product of war. They exist before and after war and are parts of the char- acter of heroes. There is scope for even higher forms of courage and heroism in peace\u2014the physical courage of those who go down to the sea in ships, descend in mines, and fly in the air, and moral courage to fight against oppression, poverty, and ill success, and temptation. As Carl von Wiegand. himslff a German, admits \"the battles of the Somme and of Verdun are the strongest refutation that manhood has deteriorated or degenerated. The much-glorified charge of the Light L'rigade pales by the sale of the fearless- ness and bravery of the Australian and Xew Zealand farmer boys. London clerks and apprentices, cabinet makers and machinists, and Trish bed carriers in charges into certain death.\" The British. brought up in the traditions of j^eace. have the mastery over war-obsessed Ger- mans. a fact due to independence of thought and institutions and assisted by the habits of self-restraint and clean liv- ing. In the topsy-turvy teaching of Ger- many it is necessary to have war to foster courage. Is war worth the expense ? It causes great social and political changes; but is it worth while going to war to obtain these changes when they are obtained by evolution ? In earth building cataclysms count for little as compared with the slow processes of nature. So in evolving a better worh^ it is not catastrophies, but the patient slow processes tiaught by nature that tell in the end. By seeking to impose kuliuT Jhrt other' nations, as Germany does, is to interfere directly with the natural course of evolution which implies differentiation. To the German small states have no right to exist. It is the glory of evolution that it lias a wealth of forms differing in size. in nature, and in capacity, so that all the resources of space and matter are utilised. The evolu- tion of nations is similar to that of animals and plants. Each should be allowed to develop on its own lines. Bernhardi assumes that the interests of states will always be in conflict. In nature, though there is struggle for existence, different organisms live in harmony and even help one another. If plants and animals can do that, why not intelligent man? Success in evolution really means the right balance of the struggle of existence and the spirit of self-sacrifice. The German believes that hard conditions such as war and all its attendant miseries tend to pro- duce the super-man. But are there not enough hardships in our lives to give us physical and moral power without engaging in so terrible a thing as war ? Germans believe that God is on their side. Biology gives no ground for the belief that the Supreme Intelli- gence interferes directly on behalf of the people engaged in combat. High ex- plosives do not seek the wicked or avoid the good. Man bas to work out his own destiny through the means, physical, in- tellectual, and moral at his disposal. It should be our aim, as the Bishop of Car- lisle said, to prove that we are on the side of God. That will assist our evolution in the direction of the highest ideal\u2014that taught us by the Christ-man. The Ger- man maintains and attempts to prove on philosophic grounds that Might gives Right; that the end justifies the means. He also wants to impart his own ideas of kultur to other misguided people, and the burnings and slayings and the destruction of civilisation show the love he bears toward the people he thus pretends to benefit. That was proved not only by the writings of Bernhardi, but by the sermons 1)f scores of the German clergy. We object to that form of philosophy in toto. We object to the attack on the slowly- evolving democracy and as Germany attacks it with guns and bayonets and",

SUDDBN DEATH OF A HORSR.\u2014On Wednesday a horse belonging to Mr E Goodwin, Rhos- street, carrier, was drawing a rather heavy lead of slack up Glwyd-street, intended to be delivered to Mr T H Roberts, tailor.

The entertainment consisted of con- juring, by M Patrice, which was mostly VEr, smart, and some capital humourous songs, etc., by Mr Alfred Leslie and Mr Alec Swann. Mr W A Lloyd, Rathta, efficiently Jicted as ac- companist, owing to the illneBB of the usual pianist of the troupe.

Among the unfortunate ens, says M.A.P. captured by the Boers at Lindley, where it nil. be remembered the 13th Battalion of the Im- perial Yeomanry lost several companies owing to the tardy arrival of reinforcements\u2014there were several Old Etonians. Among others were two who had only just gone out to join their Battalions\u2014Kenneth and Lancelot Elphinstone -the two youngest sons of Sir Howard Elphin. stone, the well-knowo legal authority on -41 Conveyancing.\" The Two Elphinstones. Kenneth, the elder of the two, is tall, slight., dark, with the regular, clear-cut features and straight nose of the family, and blue eyes that have a merry twinkle in their depths. He if. a young gentleman of many parts, a daring rider, a good cricketer, and fond of rowing. There is no better hand at a rattling game of tennis. He is a keen botanist, and since going out to the front he has added yet another accomplishment by becsming assistant-cook to his company mess. Mr. Launcelot Elpliinstone is exceedingly lilte bis brother in looks, but in some degrees fairer. He is equally fond of outdoor sports, being, if knything, a more enthusiastic horse lover and tennis player. His special hobby, however, is photography. The Hon. Ernest Pomeroy. Another of the prisoners taken with the 13th Battalion Imperial Yeomanry at Lindley was the Hon. Ernest Pomeroy. Mr. E. Pomeroy is of medium height, with brown hair, good eyes of a bluish hue, and a dark brown moustache. His smile is most pleasant, and he displays a beautiful set of teeth. His manners, which he inherits from his mother, Viscountess Harber- ton, are charming, and taken all round lie is a real good fellow.\" He was for some years in a Hussar regiment out in India. He is a fearless and skilful polo-player; in- deed, on several occassions he has received a good hard knock,\" and yet has persisted in continuing his play. Cricket is also a favourite game of his, and he has rattled up many a good score. But his first and greatest love as a iaportsman is the good o!d national sport of hunting, and his one and only real accident was got some years ago, when, in taking a high oxer, his horse crossed his leg and fell heavily with his rider. For some weeks his life was desparied of, but, happily, he is none the worse to-day. A Popular Conductor. Mr. Henry J. Wood, the popular conductor of the Promenade Concerts at Queen's Hall, is a Londoner by birth, and obtained his musical education at the Royal Academy of Music. He has been associated with several opera com- panies, is a composer of considerable ability, and is a teacher of singing of world renown. His wife is the only daughter of the late Princess Sofie Ouronsoff, whorq he married in 1898. Some months ago, when he conducted a concert be- fore the Queen, her Majesty inquired if was a German, and seemed surprise that he was not. It is not true, however, that he purposes call- ing himself Herr Heinrieh J. Holz! His appear- ance suggests Italian parentage. The Countess of Hopetoun. Lady Hopetoun, the wife of the new Governor-General of Australia, is considered one of the best hostesses in England. She is always full of fun, very witty, and yet withal quite the grande dame.\" le She was exceedingly popular in Melbourne when Lord Hopetoun was Governor of Victoria, and their \"surpise\" entertainments started quite a new fashion in the city. They kept quite a menagerie at Government House, and after dinner it was a recognige amusement to go and see the animals.\" Lady Hopetoun is very fond of horses and a splendid whip, and drives a four-in-hand. Her two sisters in-law, the Ladies Hope, have a very successful Shetland pony farm, in which she is greatly in- terested. Her eldest boy: Lord Hope, is a god- son of the Queen. The second son was born in Australia, and was named Charles Mel. bourne Hope, by his mother's wish, in honour of the colony. A Distinguished Biologist. Professor Baldwin Spencer, who fills the Chair of Biology in the University of Melbourne, has, at the request of the Royal Geographical Society and other scientific bodies, received 12 months'leave of absence to enable him to pursue his valuable first-hand researches into the customs and beliefs of the surviving tribes of blacks in the far interior of South Australia. A couple of years ago he attended a grand gathering of these tribes, and elicited much curious and novel in- formation. A native of Lancashire, and edu- cated in the first instance at Owens College, Manchester, he was subsequently elected to an open science scholarship at Exeter College, Oxford, and acted as assistant to the Linacre Professor of Comparative Anatomy. In March 1886 he was chosen Fellow of Lincoln College, and in the following year received his call to the Chair of Biology in the Melbourne University, which he ha& occupied witii much diistinctioia ever since, Lord Farnham. Lord Farnham, whose death was recently reported but happily proved incorrect, belongs to a family in which the order of succession has been governed by a strange fate. There is, indeed, a kind of superstition in Cavan, where the Farnham property lies, that the holder of the title can never transmit it to his eldest eon, and this superstition received a tragic encouragement when, in 1897, the heir to the barony, the Hon. Barry Somerset Max- well, was killed through a bicycle accident at the very close of a scries of enthusiastic celebra- tions organised in honour of his coming of age. It is also a fact that for the last 100 years, from the time of the accession of the 4th baron to the family estates, in October 1800, there has only been one instance where a son succeeded his father. This son was Henry Maxwell, the seventh baron, who, along with his wife, was hurried to a terrible death in the frightful railway catas- trophe at Abergele in 1868. Only on three oc- casions since the creation of the barony in 1756 has the title descended to the eldest son. In two instances a Lord Farnham has become, first a viscount, and then an earl, but through lapse of issue these higher titles became extinct in each case. The gaps that have oc- curred in the direct succession is well illus- trated in the present peer. The Rev. Henry Maxwell, the sixth baron, had no fewer than pine sons. Three of these, the first, second, and sixth sons, followed each other in the peerage. Lord Farnham, who now holds the title, had for his father the seventh son. Out of the whole nine sons he and a brother were the only male heirs begotten. The First Englishwomall to Enter Pekin. A bright little contemporary has recently pointed out the fact, interesting just now when JLII thoughts are turned to Pekin, that the first Englishwoman to enter the Forbidden City is still living Mrs. Muter, the wife of an officer with a brilliant Indian career, Colonel D. D. Muter, late of the 60th Rifles, and now one of the Military Knights of Windsor. This is so, but I have it from Mrs. Muter lierself that the Pelican makes a little -slip\u2014pardonable enough after all these years-in adding that she entered the 1 city \"with the troops,\" Mrs. Muter certainly ac- cennpanied her brave husband practically every- where throughouthii eventful military career, but on the memorable occasion referred to, 1ihe did not enter Pekin with him and the soldiers under his command, but a little later, and on the express invitation of Sir Frederic Briiee-brother of Lord Elgin-wllo was the British Minister in Pekin at the time.-M.A .P.",

The long-bill, however, is flushod again, and missed by a too excited sportsman, but is marked down to an iuch. How cautiously but rapidly the whole line ad- vances; it is a moment of intense emotion; he is flushed again, and down he comes, the victim of the three or four guns\" nearest him, each of whom modestly disclaims the special act, but with an air vastly savouring of secret triumph. The bird is well examined and bagged, and then they all march back again to the pheasants and the hares with an immense addition of satisfaction: There is more fun in an acoidental woodcock, to all save the keeper, than in a hundrcd ordinary\" head.\" Sir Creswell Cresswell has just flushed a very magnificent woodcock in his well-stocked preserves at the Divorce Court, j Verily was he a bird of passage, and he lived by suction indeed. Charles Tucker, alias De St. Hiliare, otherwise Marquis De St. Hillaire, afterwards Alessandro Count of Borromeo, and of the Holy Roman Empire, sometimes Dr. Charles Tucker, at other times demagogue, lecturer, usher, and showman, but always swindler, was respondent, on Friday last, to a petition for divorce)fi charges of bigamy, polygamy, adultery, and desertion. The ordinary pheasants and hares of the matrimonial shooting in the Divoroe Court were tamo in comparison to such a woodcock as this, and he was marked down and followed tip by the keen sportsmen of that delicate district to an amusing extent. The Emerald Isle is supposed to havo the honour of his nativity, but he was able to pass himself off, in his first marriage in 1842, as an Italian. In 1847 he abandoned his wife and betook himself to Sheffield, where he announced himself .v. Count Alessaudro de Borromeo, son of the Duke of ditto.andapolitical exile. He there delivered inflam- matory speeches of the usual tono; made himself a per- soiiage of some importance, so much so that he was very nearly being elected a member of the town council, which seems to imply that the honest cutlers are not quite so keen as the wares they vend. He, however, so far proved his popularity that he managed to coax little sums of money out of every one he knew, and he used his inflammatory speeches for more purposes than politics, for he persuaded a young lad;, to elo with him to Gretna, where they were married in 1847. With this wife he remained till 1851 but then deserted and went off to Belfast, where he dropped the Italian titles for a while and called himself Dr. Tucker, and lecturer on mesmerism. The lectures didn't pay, so he proposed to found a mesmeric hospital; and, having managed to collect I a considerable subscription for that purpose, lie decamped with the money. He then sought variety, as showman to a travelling panorama; but happen- ing to make the acquaintance of a poor girl with a few hundred pounds in her possession, he stuck close to her as long as they lasted, representing himself as Dr. Tucker, physician to St. George's Hospital, the ingenious title to his diploma being that he had once been a patient in that praiseworthy institution. The hundreds gone, he departed also, and kept himself from starving by the old trick of Vvriusr a few days at hotels, and leaving a carpet bag filled newer dodge, ana one more worthy a man of his genius, He announced himself at Kilkenny as a Count of the Holy Roman Empire, of the Pontifical degree (whatever that last phrase may mean), the victim of religious persecution on account of his conversion from Papistry to Protestantism. Of course in such a locale the Protestant clergy rallied round their convert, aided him with money, and ended by procuring him au appointment as French teacher in a re- spectable school. But his too susceptible heart was agaiu his bane. He proposes to another young lady, whom he dupes into marrying him in not quite the regular manner, on account of his rank in the Holy Roman Empire!\" The poor thing seems to have been satisfied with any manner\" he chose, and they lived together as man and wife for some little time; but, after having extracted a considerable sum of money from her friends, he abandoned her too, and decamped to London. Here, having picked up another female victim, he had the boldness to venture upon the device of fabricating accounts of secret con- ferences held by Italian exiles in the cause of freedom, and selling them to the newspapers as genuine. This was a little. too ilcautious and accordingly, one fine day, when he was lecturing in the Reading Theatre on electro-biology, his biology was electrified by his being arrested for obtain- ing money on false pretences. What came of that does not appear, but in August, 1838, he was convicted of bigamy and sentenced to four years' penal servitude. Consequently lie was not present at the narrative of his interesting history on Friday last, but as all the charges were fully proved his wife, \"his original wife, of course obtained her di vorce nisi. What au amusing memoir such a vagabond could write would he but give us the details with honesty and candour. But what a humiliating opinion does it not give us of the vanity, folly, and credulity in those who could become tho victims to such an impostor. All traces of common sense, prudence, or caution seem to evaporate the moment these sharpers call themselves French comtes or Italian marquises. Men give their money, women give themselves, with a recklessness perfectly marvellous. One of their own countrymen and of their own sphere might plead for months without obtaining a sixpence or a smile. As plain Mr. Tucker, the scamp before us can do nothing as the Italian Signor he gains a respectable wife at once; as Marquis, Count, or even as Doctor (anything above the rank of his victims), purses, places, and charms seem to drop into his grasp for mere asking. When will our fellow-citizens of either sex acknowledge the imbecility and misery of all this? When will they learn to \"look before they leap,\" especially when such an important item as money or hap- piness is at stake ? Though we cannot but regard the hero of last Friday as one of the most unmitigated scoundrels extant, we cannot feel one grain of pity or regret for his dupes. They owe all they do, or may suffer, to their own incomprehensible folly.\u2014Morning Post",

                "full_text": "n Outlines of Industrial History [CONCLUSION. ] lU THE :MARXIAN THEORIES. I THE MARXIAN THEORIES. \ufffc \ufffc the men to their message. The Marxian ?M heories can be well compared to a triangle with th 6 Laoour Theory of Value, the Theory of Sur- is-laboiir and the Materialist Conception of His itory as its three sides. In our lesson Session, We have had chiefly to do with the latter though the two former are bound up with it and would :also repay investigation and test. The M.C.H. 'Was first formulated in the Communist Mani- festo The history of all hitherto existing societ T (i.e., all written history) is the history \u2022of cla. S8 struggles.\" And in later works, the theory was enlarged and applied to the history of difft 'rent nations. The historic mission of the \"working class, the true nature of the State, and working, underlying factor beneath all changes in ideas we re all perceived even when the Manifesto was peni ied in 1848. (\u00f3 History for the first time,\" w rrote Engels, \"was placed en its real foundation n; the obvious fact, hitherto totally ne- glected, t hat first of all men must eat, drink, have sheJ ter and clothing, and therefore must work, bef ore they can struggle far supremacy and devot e themselves to politics, religion, philo- ,sophy, etc .-this obvious fact at last found his- torical rec ognition. As we h aye already dealt with the logic of the machine ai ad seen how social relations are based upon tool-' ownership and that the class which owns the t ools is very different from the other class that i s forced to use those tools in order to get a living > besides having consistently used this theory right throughout our lessons, there is no need to dwell upon it further. Though the \"expectations and prophesies of the historic mani- festo were r; fulfilled, yet the theory explains in a, scientifi manner its own mistakes and as a method of L king upon society and explaining its evolution is Unparalleled. There is on other matter that should be men- tioned before our final conclusion. When giving particulars c( mcerlling the lives of Marx and Engels, we fr ound that botli took up the study <of philosophy in which branch of learning at that time Hegel w as the leading light. It is some- times alleged that the work of Marx is vitiated \u00a3 ty this Hegeli an influence and that he lacked the insight in to society which Darwinism later brought. Apa rt from this mixing up, in an \"organic\" vie w of society, of biology and socio- logy, this mi sconception of Hegelianism (for it taught evolut ion in general before Darwin gave it individual f specific proof in biology) .and this false assumpti on that Marx did not know and \"appreciate Dai 'win's work, there is also a sad ^neglect of the A Tital difference between the philo- sophy of Hegel and Historical Nlaterialism. There is roon t. here only for a brief reference to that diffgrenc D. Hegel, living in revolutionary times, with his \"dialectic method\" saw move- ment through ir Iherent struggle. But he was misled by the ide, ological form which the contest took. To him it was the Absolute Idea\" coming to recegnit ion in the minds of men. For example, feudalism broke down, because the feu- dal ideas became 0, bsolete in the face of new; Socialism from the Hegelian viewpoint will come because old ideas ale displaced by new. In later reactionary times I legel's tame political conclu- sions and hisglerific ation of the State, made him IPopular with the rul ing powers. Bernstein in his Ferdinand Lassallt 1 as Social Reformer shows how the works of La ssalle-\"the man who forged the sword of Social Democracy in Germany\"\u2014 \"vitiated by his adherence to the Hegelian \"idea\" \u00ab as a cause of progress. The mysticism of H egel over the\" Absolute Idea was attacked 1 lY the Left wing of his school, which accepted his method but rejected his conclusions. W1 ith 3 clegel the world stood on .its head, i.e., on the idc a. Marx stood it on its feet and showed that 1 deas were generated in material conditions. With me,\" wrote he Kp. 30 \"Capital\"), \"-the ideal is nothing else than the material worl d reflected by the human mind and transformed into forms of thought.\" The relations between ideas and the conditions which genera/fee them ws more fully explained in -the, Preface of \"The critique (1859). THE FUTURE. I What of it? Will orrr twenty Lessons help us to face it? If they do not they have failed. The sole object of our meeti ng is to get a knowledge of past events and of theories which truly ex- -plain the facts of our working life and which will guide us in future practice. Our classes are. con- nected with an insbitutlon which had its birth in the Industrial Uni-eiit. The C.L.C. was -founded in 1909 out of th,'e most unique strike on record. It aims to sprea.d independent working- -class education and upon its curriculwrn figure the truths arrived at by these two German thinkers, who gave themselves so wholehearted- ly and\" wholeheadedly\" to the workers' cause. 1, The good they did was not interred with the bones of Marx at Highgate, nor lost in the sea into which the dust of Engels was thrown, but lives on and fertilizes in the conquering army of \u2022an intellectual Labour Movement, by the side of whose cradle Marx and Engels stood at the dawn of a new day.\" Vain are the hopes of ari industrial peace. Like snow upon the mountain side they will vanish before the sun of economic heat. In every country capitalism begets its gravediggers. In its endeavour to increase its profits it will force the workers to take up a militant attitude upon the industrial, political and educational fields and progress will accelerate until the workers of the world will unite and their emancipation be accomplished. To the Day! IIEADING.-\u2014\" Karl Marx Biographical Memoirs,\" Leibnecht. Karl Marx,\" Spargo. Books and pamphlets by Mar x/ and Engels are too numerous to list and are obtainable at cheap ? -^tes.

W E. Sack ville-West (chair- man) Me W. Rathbone, M.P., (vice-chair), Sir R. A. Cuniiffe, Bart., M.P.. Mr W. A. Darbishire, Rev. Gethin Davies, Mr J. R. Davies; Mr Richard Davies, M.P., Rev. Samuel Davies, Rev. Herber Evans, Mr Thomas Gee, Mr E. J. Griffith, Mr J. Lloyd Griffith., Professor Henry Jones, Mr R. A. Jones, Right Hon. G. Osborne Morgan, M.P., Mr A. C. Humphreys- Owen, Mr P; P; Pennant, Right Hon. the Earl of Powis, Mr Principal Reichel, Professor Rhys, Mr J. Roberts, M.P., Mr John Roberts (Brynadda), Rev. Daniel Rowlands, Captain E. H. Verney, Mr T. Marchant Williams, Mr William Williams, and Mr Cadwalder Davies (secretary). Mr John Roberts, M.P., and Mr Darbishire brought up the report of the Finance and Buildings Com- mittee, from which it appeared that. out of a total of 232,000 promised towards the college, gl-i,500 had already been paid, leaving a balance of 214,500 to be collected. It was calculated that the cost of the building, alterations, fittings, and furniture would amount to 25000i, Deducting this sum and 21500 for preliminary expenses out of the promises actually paid, the balance of the capital to yield income wheat invested would be 211,000. The current payments to which the council was committed were 24850, showing a deficit of \u00a3 500-to 2600 a year until further subscrip- tions are paid up. The reports were adopted and ar. rangements made to collect additional subscriptions. \u2014Colonel West brought up the report of the General Purposes Committee, which stated that the Duke of Westminster had promised to attend the opening ceremony of the college at Bangor, on the 17th and 18th of October. The secretary was also directed to in- vite Lord Carlingford and Mr Mundella to attend on I the occasion.\u2014The next business on the agenda was the appointment of professor of modern languages and lectures in biology and Welsh. The Principal read a report of the Senate on the applications. Notice was given of a motion for the next meeting o? the council to rescind a professor at jMOO, and also & motion tojthe effect that the lecturers should be appointed at \u00a3 200 \u00bb year, with shares of the feee. The secretary was directed to ascertain from the existing candidates whether they would accept the appointment on the altered footing. Colonel West, Mr R. A. Jones, Captain Verney, and Mr J. Roberts, (Bangor), were appointed a committee with the Senate; to consider and reduce; the applications. The appoint- ments of lecturers in biology and Welsh were deferred. \u2014Mr Humphreys Owen brought up the report of the; Charter CLmraitteet which stated that the draft charter was about being submitted to the Privy Council, and after adopting a resolution to the effect that the order of retirement amongst the 17 members of the council elected by the Court of governors; should be decided by lot, and the rejection of several amendments, the report was adooted. It was proposed by Mr Gee, and seconded by Mr J. Roberts, Bryn Adda, \"That the repre- sentatives of the press be admitted to the meetings of the council,\" and it was proposed and seconded;, with the addition of the following words:\u2014 Unless excluded by the vote of three-fourths of the members present at any of the meetings of the council.\" The following amendment was proposed by Mr W. Williams, Aberystwyth, and seconded by Mr E. J. Griffith, That, with a view to provide accu- rate information of the action of the council, the; secretary be directed, to communicate after each, council meeting to the principal papers circulating, itk North Wales an official report of every resolution passed at such meeting, and that;, on the requisition of any three members; the names of those voting for or against any motion or amendment shall be re- corded and submitted with the minutes to the nexto meeting of the Court of Governors, who shall publish; the names if they think proper, provided that no record shall be taken of the names of any supporter I' or opposer of any motion or amendment dealing with the election or removal of a professer or lecturer, on affecting the; character or status of any individual.\" I; The amendment was carried, and upon being put as a substantive motion, an amendment was, pro- posed by Mr J. Roberts, Bryn Adda, and seconded- by Mr R. A. Jones, to the effect that after each council meeting the minutes should, upon the requisition of any three members, be communicated to the newspapers, with resolutions. amendments, and names of those voting. This, how- ever, was rejected, and the substantive motion was carried. \u2014 Considerable discussion ensued on this amendment. Its supporters urged that the governors and the public who had subscribed, so largely to the college were entitled to know without delay the pro- ceedings of the council, and the action of individual members therein, and that it would be an illusive concession simply to produce the minute book of the; council in the meeting of the court of governors. The business of the meetings of the court could not be delayed to enable the numerous governors to inspect the minutes. The court of governors would, there- fore, be practically prevented from exercising any in- fluence over the action of individual members of the council. It was further urged that it would: be un- just that individuals composing the minority in the council should be held responsible by the public foe resolutions of the council of which they disapproved; \u2014Professor Rhys contended, that the council was re- sponsible only to the court of governors and; not to the public.\u2014Mr Pennant and Sir Robert Cunliffe, considered that eventually it might be desirable to move in the direction indicated by the amendment, but that for the present it would perhaps be better for the council to feel its way gradually.\u2014Other op- ponents of the amendment argued also that it was not usual for the council of a college (which it was, contended was purely an executive body likei a Ministerial Cabinet) to inform the public of its pro. ceedings, and that to do so would only lead to unde- sirablei newspaper controversies that would be in. jurious to the interests of the college.\u2014On a division the following members voted for the amendment Mr J. R. Davies, Rev. E. Herber Evans, Mr Gee, Mr E. J. Griffith, Mr R. A. Jones, the Right Hon. G. 0. Morgan, M.P., and Mr J. Roberts. Bryn Adda. The resolution supported by Sir Robert Cunliffe, M.P.. Mr W. A. Darbishire, Mr R. Davies, M.P., Rev. Samuel Davies, Mr J. Lloyd Griffith, Professor Henry Jones, Mr A. C. Humphreys-Owen, Mr P. P. Pennant, the Right Hon. the Earl of Powis, Mr W. Rathbone, M.P., Professor Rhys, Mr J. Roberts; M.P., Rev. D. Rowlands, Capt. Verney. and Mr W. Williams, was carried.\u2014A motion dealing with, the; length of the college terms was referred to the Charter and the Statutes Committee. The Senate was author ised to award the scholarships about to be competed for and to publish the results.-During the morning., meetings were held of the Charter and Statutes Com- mittee and the Finance Committee.",
