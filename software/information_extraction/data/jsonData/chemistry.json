Institution, Swanoen, on Thursday evening. The Mayor (Alderman Tulloch), in opening the pro- ceedings, contrasted the facilities which the youth of the present day enjoyed for educational pur- poses with those ot the past. Fifty or sixty years ago all the education which the middle-class children could obtain was by means of dame schools, and they might be sure it was of the must elementary character\u2014consisting only of the three it's, If he mastered those he was considered fit to fin any ordinary situation, and tu successfully tight life's battles. The education of more modern d\u00abYd had taken, indeed, a wide and comprehensive scope. The arts and sciences are now taught, and our youths and others of more advanced age are practically grounded in that special education fitting them to take a prominent part in our great; scientific, engineering, and commercial life. In his opinion, creat as was the progress of national education, Swansea saoly needed a scientific and technical college, which would enable us to suc- cessfully crown the local efforts we had made in this direction. In no district did better or more diversified means exist to give practical lessons in the arts than Swansea, and our duty therefore was clear. They should all, individually and collectively, do everything in their power to induce the Government to aid us in ou--endeavours to establish a technical college iu Swansea, and it he, in his oflicial capacity, could help forward such an important movement, he need hardly assure them he would have much pleasure in doing so.

MORGAN, of the Technical Institute and South Wales School of Chemistry, Nelson-street, Swansea, recently applied to the examining Board of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons that his Institute should be recognised as a place of instruction in chemistry, physics, and practical chemistry for the examinations which are held under the Examining Board. This has been granted, and Dr. Morgan's well-known and admir- ably-conducted Institute in Nelson-street is registered under the Examining Board of the two important medical colleges mentioned above. These Royal Colleges have also adopted another recommendation of the com- mittee, viz., that students be admitted to examination in chemistry, physics, and practical chemistry, before registration as medical students. These are important edu- cational concessions, such as ought to prove of much good in the furtherance of technical education in South Wales. Dr. Morgan intends next year to add biology to his curriculum.",

Last (Thursday) evening, at the Royal Institution of South Wales, the distribution of prizes in connection with the Science and Art Schools took place in the presence of an appreciative audience. There were, however, very few students present. His Worship the Mayor (L Tulloch. Esq) presided, and there were present Messrs. J. C. Vye-Parminter, Phillip Rogers, C. H. Perkins, J. R. Leaver, &c. The Chairman, in opening the proceedings, said:\u2014 Ladies and gentlemen,\u2014It affords me much pleasure to preside in my official capacity at this prize distribution in connection with the Arts and Science Classes in Swansea. I do so for two reasons. First, because having been unfortunately deprived in my youth of many of the advantages of education. I rejoice in all the facilities, which are now within the reach of all classes, to avail themselves of the blessings of educa- tion. My second reason for pleasure at presiding is because I consider it the duty of the Mayor of a City or Town to lend his countenance and support to all educationary means calculated to stimulate and encourage the youths in their studies. (Applause.) I some times contrast my younger days in an educational point of view, with those of the present day. Fifty or sixty years ago all the educa tion which the middle-class children could obtain was by means of dame schools, and you may be sure it was of the most elementary character. A boy's education- anycarioulum in those days consisted of the three Rs, reading, writing, and arithmetic, and if he mastered ose he was considered fit to fill any situation, and to successfully fight life's battles. But what immenco xr\u00ab\u201e.ieH+-u been made since those days. j+v,;\u2122 +v! ^^ages of education are placed r< .0!.t ^1}' anc* n0 single child in [ I. v ? without those educational means Which will raise him in the intellectual, the moral, and social scale. But the education of moro has taken a still wider and more comprehensive scope by means of our board schools and classes connected with various ociGntiiic Institutions. arts and sciences are now taught and our youths and others of more advanced age are practically grounded in that special education fitting them to take a prominent part in our great scientific engineering and commercial life. (Applause) This branch of our National Education has been too long, far too long, neglected, but all must rejoice to find that the Government and the nation has at length awoke to their duty, and the progress of late years has been most satisfactory. Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot conclude these few fragmentary remarks without saying that Swansea sadly needs a Scientific and Technical College, which will enable us to successfully crown the local efforts we have made in this direction; of the many great manu- facturing centres of industry in the United Kingdom none needs such an institution more than Swansea, and in no district does their exist better or more diversified means to give practical lessons in the arts than in Swansea, and our duty therefore is clear. Let us all individually and collectively do everything in our our power to induce the Government to aid us in our en- deavours to establish such a Technical College in Swansea, and if I, in my official capacity, can help forward such an important movement, I need hardly assure you 1 shall have much pleasure in so doing. I heartily congratulate the studenrs \u00abho have been successful in winning prizes, and hoped it would be an incentive to them to still plod on in their upward career, remembering that success always ciowns honest labour, and that \"Water falling day by day wear the hardest rock away.\" (Applause.) The names of the prize and certificate takers were:\u2014 Llewellyn B. Birchall, practical and inorganic chemistry; Edward H. Bishop, practical and inoiganic chemistry; Edward H. Bishop, inorganic chemistry; Mm-garst J. Bowen, phyaioxraphy Daniel Bray, rn- organic chemistry; John H. Ciutton, physiography; John H. Ciutton, practical and inorganic chemistry John H.

The teachers were Messrs. W. and B. Terrill and John Williams. This concluded the prize distiibution. Mr Hor;. lluxham remarked that he felt greatly dis- appointed at seeing so few) resent. They were, he was sure, greatly indebted to their worthy Mayor for pre- siding at their meeting. He would, therefore, move that a hearty vote of thanks be accorded to him. Mr li. H. Glascodine, in seconding, remarked upon the great educational advantages which the present genera. tion possessed. Mr J. C. Vye-Parminter said he congratulated all those student? who had been successful in gaining prizes. He felt grieved and disappointed that so few of the students were present. He then moved that the best thanks of that meeting be accorded to the honorary secretary, Mr Hort. Huxham. Mr W. Terrill, F.S.C. (one of the teachers), seconded. He remarked that the advantages of the present day did not seem to be so very much better than the olden times, judging from the Mayor and Mr Glascodine themselves. He then alluded to the Science and Art scheme irtended to provide scientific teaching to help the workmen in his work. This scheme, he said, had failed to a great extent in its object, inasmuch as the education was \"cramped\" by their syllalabes into a line not so beneficial to the workmen as it might be. Hence, not- withstanding the fact that the scheme had been in existence over 30 years, yet there was an outcry for a. Technical College in Swansea, a question which it was to be hoped the Mayor would in his year of Mayoralty bring to the fore as it had been fomenting in Swansea. for the last couple of years. The Mayor having replied, The propositions were put to the meeting and oamea item con. The proceedings then terminate'4.",

The successes gained by pupils from this school at th > London Matriculation Examination in June reflect great credit both on the pupils themselves and on the masters responsible for their training. The list of successful candidates, published this week, includes the name, of the following Cyfarthfa pupils. Trevor Maldwyn Evans (English, Mathematics, Mechanics. French and Chemistry) Frederick H. Harris (English, Mathematics, Magnetism and Elec- tricity, French and Chemistry) Leslie Richards (English, Mathematics, Magnetism and Elec- tricity, Welsh, and COeniistry); David Ernest Watkins (English. Mathematics, Magnetism and Electricity, French, and Chemistry); and ldr Phillips (English, Mathematics, Magnetism and Electricity, French, and Chemistry). The fol- lowing pupils, also, taking advantage of the pri- vilege extended to those who had already passed in four subjects at this examination, and had been called from their school to serve with H-M Forces, or to work in munition factories, passed each in the one subject necessary to- complete their success: Robert H.

A correspondent writes In these days of intense competition and overcrowded professions it may not be out of place to point to a real opening for a few good men. Electrical engineer. ing will soon be nearly as crowded as some of the older callings, but the application of electricity to chemical manufacturing processes is but just beginning to develop. There seems to be a great dearth at the present time of young men who, besides possessing a good knowledge of electricity, have some acquaintance with commercial chemistry beyond what may have been picked up at a school or university laboratory. Electro- chemists are made, not born, and the process takes time; and, having regard to the rapid strides that electro-chemistry is making, it seems probable that there will soon be a considerable demand for young men possessing the requisite knowledge of both chemistry and electricity.\"",

Professor Ramsay studied at Glasgow University, graduated in Germany, and was afterwards demonstrator at Glasgow Uiiiversit3 for six years. He came to Bristol ia March, 1880, as professor of chemistry, and was appointed prin- cipal of the college in October, 1881. Dr. Ramsay is one of the secretaries of the movement for securing Government aid to university colleges, and in connection with this subject it may be of interest to state that on the 30th June a deputa- tion will wait on the Chancellor of the Exchequer urging the claims of these institutions. A motion will shortly be made in the House of Commons by Sir J.ihn Lubbock on the same subject.",

A student who has already passed some recog- nised preliminary examination such as the London matriculation, will, in order, to spend one medical year at Cardiff, have to attend the senior and intermediate classes in chemistry, a course of practical chemistry involving six hours' work per week in the laboratory,and the intermediate class in zoology, together with the practical work in connection therewith. The college has also been recognised by the University of Edinburgh as an institution at which two out of the three years of study neces sary for the degree of bachelor of science can be passed.",

Thirty lectures were delivered by Mr F. V. Dutton, assistant lecturer in agricultural chemistry, and about fifty hours' work was done in the laboratory. The students who attended were masters in elementary and secondary schools, and among them were several old University College of North Wales students, who very much enjoyed this reminder of old times, and who would be glad to see such re-unions occur annually and increase in numbers. Mr Dutton succeeded in making it clear to all how important and absorbingly interesting the teaching of chemistry in its technical aspect must prove to Wales in the future. The course was brought to a close by a visit to the Bangor Gasworks, and the various pro- cesses of manufacture and purification were kindly explained by the manager, Mr Smith.",

Electrical engineer- ing will soon be nearly as crowded as some of the older callings, but the application of electricity to chemical manufacturing processes is but just beginning to develop. There seems to be a great dearth at the present time of young men who, besides possessing a good knowledge of electricity, have some acquaintance with commercial chemistry beyond what may have been picked up at a school or university laboratory. Electro- chemists are made, not born, and the process takes time; and, having regard to the rapid strides that electro-chemistry is making, it seems probable that there will soon be a considerable demand for young men possessing the requisite j knowledge of both chemistry and electricity.\"",

JOHN HUNTER SMITH, B.Sc. I nock, and was formerly a aistinguished student of Kilmarnock Academy. After some years' experience of practical work on the farm, he proceeded to Glasgow University and Agricultural College to begin an extended course of study for the B.Sc. degree in agri- culture. At the very beginning of his college career he gain-ed the most valuable bursary of his year offered in agricultural science, and subsequently won numerous first prizes and first-claas certificates. Basides graduating at Glasgow University, he secured the national diplomas in agriculture and in dairying, the possession, of which implies not a theoretical knowledge only, but a close practical acquaintance with these subjects. As a student Mr. Smith has filled all the chief posts of honour in his college, such as secretary, and finally president of the Students' Discussion Society, and convener of the annual reunion committee. Since taking his degree he has gone through extended courses of post-graduate study, chiefly in organic chemistry, agricultural chemistry, metallurgy, and the chemistry and bacteriology of public health. He has held the appointments of demonstrator in chemistry in Glasgow University, and assis- tant to the professor of chemistry in the Glasgow Agricultural College. During the greater part of the past summer he has acted as superintendent of the college experiment station at Holmes Farm, an experience which should prove invaluable to him in his experi- mental field work of the future. He goes South to commenoo his duties on October 1.",

After some years' experience of practical work on the farm, he proceeded to Glasgow University and Agricultural College to begin an extended course of study for the B.Sc. degree in agri- culture. At the very beginni11 of his college career he gained tbe most valuable bursary of his year offered in agricultural science, and subsequently won numerous first prizes and first-class certificates. Besides graduating at Glasgow University, he secured the national diplomas in agriculture and in dairying, the possession of which implies not a theoretical knowledge only, but a close practical acquaintance with these subjects. As a student Mr. Smith has filled all the chief posts of honour in his college, such as secretary, and finally president of the Students' Discussion society, and convener of the annual reunion committee. Since taking his degree he has gone through extended courses of post-graduate study, iehiefly in organic chemistry, agricultural chemistry, metallurgy, and the chemistry and bacteriology of public health. He has be!d the appointments of demonstrator in chemistry in Glasgow University, and assis- tant to the professor of chemistry in the Glasgow Agricultural College. During the greater part of the past summer he has acted as superintendent of the college experiment station at Holmee Farm, an experience which should prove invaluable to him in his experi- mental field work of the future.

Professor Dmitri Ivanovitch Mendelejeff was born at Tobolsk, Siberia, in 1834, and became Professor of Chemistry at the University of St. Petersburg in 1866. His most notable discovery was the formulation of the \"Periodic Law,\" by which he was enabled to predict the existence of numerous undiscovered elements and even the probable properties which these elements would be found to possess. These predictions have since been verified to a very full extent. Profes- sor Mendelejeff was the author of a work, en- titled \"Principles of Chemistry,\" which has been translated into most European languages.",

In 1891 he gained an 1856 Exhibition Research Scholarship, and proceeded to the University of Heidelberg, where he worked for three years under the late Professor Victor Meyer. During his last year at Heidelberg, Dr Sudborcugh acted as one of the assistants in the University laboratories. In 1894 he was awarded an Honorary Research Fellowship at Owena College, Manchester, where he worked in the organic laboratory until his appointment at Nottingham in 1895. There he has given complete courses in both inorganic and organic chemistry, and has had the general supervision of the work in the chemical laboratories and has carried out research work with some of the more advanced students. During the past ten years, Dr Sudborough has published either conjointly or alone some twenty-six papers contained original work.

It is the direct application of applied chemistry to manufactures. The Trades Unionist objects to youths being taught trades at science and art schools, but what Dr. Harris suggests is, not to teach the trade or profession of chemistry or dyeing or coal tar production, but the uses of applied chemistry to trades of special kinds. It is an extension of the simple laboratory by making it a good deal more practical than at present. Of course, a boy who wants to-go to a trade will havo to learn the handicraft and details of that trade, but how big and im- portant a step it is for him to know the exact effect of chemistry and chemicals unon the material he will have to handle. The idett is an excellent one, and is easily capable of being elaborated either in the special cases mentioned by Dr. Harris or in connection with industries which are already established in Xewport and the district.",

He was born at Frankfort-on-the- Maine, and received his chief education at the University of Gottingen. In early life be came to England, and he successively held the posts of assistant of the late Professor Johnston, at Edin- burgh, Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Agri- cultural College at Circenster, and Professor of Chemistry to the Royal Agricultural Society of England. He was well known as the author of several works on theoretical and agricultural chemistry, such as \"The Chemistry of Food and The Chemistry of Manures.\" Should a rumour going the round of the press prove authentic, English cricket is destined shortly to lose one of its foremost exponents in the person of Mr C. T. Studd, who has, it is said, resolved to enter upon the career of a missionary in China. The famous \"Blue\" will carry with him the best wishes of every, true lover of cricket. Let us hope that, whilst attending to the spiritual wants of the\" Celestials,\" he will not overlook the humanising influences of the pastime in which he himself delights. A \"heathen Chinee\" eleven would constitute a huge attraction at Lord's or the Oval. Mr Swann, of the C.U.B.C., will probably accompany\" C. T.\" The construction of the Swallow, a large, heavily- armed composite gun-vessel of a new type, was commenced at Sheerness Dockyard on Monday. The Swallow, which will be equipped with eight five-inch guns, is the most powerful gun-vessel at present laid down for the Royal Navy. On Monday Police-Inspector Teggins, of the Birmingham Police Force, died at the Queen's Hospital from the result of a fall from an omnibus in the Hagley-road. While descending from the conveyance the inspector slipped from the ladder, breaking his leg. Deceased had been in the force 30 years, and was much respected.",

James, 3, Gilgal Terrace, Pennar, Pembroke Dock ,writes to inform us as follows I beg to inform you that the lists of the subjects in which I obtained a Central Welsh Board Senior Certificate was incomplete as published in your paper last week. You omitt- ed to say that I passed in Latin (with distinc- tion), and in Mathematics (with distinction). I should be obliged if you will correct this error in your next issue. Perhaps it would be con- venient if I give a correct list of the subjects in which I obtained a certificate:\u2014Composition, English Language (with distinction), English History (with distinction), English Literature, French (with distinction and conversational power), Latin (with distinction), Arithmetic (with distinction), Mathematics (with distinc- tion), Chemistry.\"",

I To-day's Proceedings, One of the best attended sections to-day is the geographical, where several papers on Central Asia are being read and discussed. Oue was by Colonel Mark Bell, Royal Engineers, who des- cribed, largely from a military point of view, the route from Pekin to our Indian frontier. He regards China not only as our customer in trade, but our possible military ally in future. Mr R. Gundry described the industrial and commercial progress of China, In the chemistry section a special committee pre- sented a report upon the present methods of teaching chemistry. These they pronounced to be unsatisfactory. In our educational institutions they insisted that elementary physical science should be taught as a branch of mental education, and not mainlyas useful knowledge is taught. Thus it would develop mental qualities frequently deadened by the exclusive study of languages, history, and mathematics. An interesting discus- sion followed.",

The subject was, The Chemistry of the Breakfast Table.\" In the course of an interesting discourse, we found that our sugar-basin con- tained a mass of charcoal in the place of sugar. Tea and coffee-making were treated at considerable length, whilst diagrams and ocular demonstrations in the shape of manifold experiments made the lecture popular and in- teresting and it proved to be one of the most useful and instructive expositions that, through the agency of the society, has been listened to in Cardiff.",

Examinations were held by the Cen- tral Welsh Board in July at the above school, and as a result seven junior certificates and five senior certificates were awarded. The value of these certi- ficates is seen from the fact that the Pharmaceutical, Law and other Societies excuse the holders of junior certificates from their entrance examination, while a student who holds the senior certificate is thereby qualified to act as teacher in an elementary school, or may be granted a King's scholarship enabling the holder to attend a Training College for teach- ers. The senior certificate is also accept- ed by the University of Wales as equivalent to the Matriculation examina- tion The following are the successful can- didates \u2014 Juniors.\u2014Pauline Cheetiham passed in Scripture, English Language, Arith- metic, French, v Geography.

The scholarships awarded out of the fund left, by the late Rich-art Owen. of The Clock, are awarded firs\" of all to boys who were born in Llandudno, who attain a satisfactory standard in the Bangor College Scholarship Examina- tion. Failing any such they may be awarded to boys who have resided in Llandudno for the past six years, and who attain a satisfactory standard. The chief scholarship hais this year been awarded to Peris .Williams, of Wrexham County School, who was born in Llandudno, and who was placed first on the Honours List in the Central Welsh Board Examination. A second exhibition of \u00a3 10 a. year was also granted to Reginald Da.vies, of the Llandudno Countv School, who was not born in this town. and so was not eligible for the chief scholarship, but who has resided here for six years. He will hold this in addition'to the College exhibition of \u00a310 announced above.",

A large number have intimated their intention of attending the chemistry lectures and the Local Committee have decided to purchase C20 worth of apparatus. The committee having invited Principal Edwards of Aberystwyth College to open both courses of lectures, he did so last Friday evening by giving a lecture in the large Assembly Rooms on the history of universities.

At a special meeting of the Pontypridd Literary Institute Committee, held on Monday night, it was resolved to accept the offer of the South Wales and Monmouthshire College authorities, and have on the opening of the coming term (iq J anuary next) a lecture each week of the term by one of the professional lecturers. The subjects from which a choice is to be made are\u2014chemistry, natural philosophy, philosophy, and geology. Chemistry and geology would be decidedly pre- ferable subjects, in so mineral a district, but the matter is at the option of the college authorities. The subscription will be 5s for the course. Already numbers have sent in their names, and some gentlemen have even subscribed a guinea towards the expenses. If this movement proves a failure, the town, it is felt, will fully and decidedly deserve the reflections upon its lack of public spirit which have been so often made.",

He was the first to observe the remarkable molecular change which occurs in iron at a dull red r.

The 3,000 delegates, who are attending the International Congress of Applied Chemistry at South Kensington, met on Friday. Papers dealing moetly with purely technical subjects were read in French, English, German, and Italian. Sir J. Crichton Browne, in his presidential address to the hygiene section, admitted that his hopes of liquid air as an important weapon in fignting disease had been entirely without foundation. He urged a standardisa- tion of disinfectants, assorting that the market at present was flooded with spurious preparations. The Lord Chief Justice addressed the section which discussed law in rela- tion to chemistry, and declared that the revoking clause of the new English patent law was a backward step.

Though it might seem a gruesome experiment, a worker in Heidelberg had just lately tested the point. He found that a dog, when fed with dog, was able to do with a much smalled quantity of protein than when fed with any other protein what- ever. Dr. Hopkins stated that the blood and tissues of one animal were not of the same character as those of another. There was a chemistry of species. The nearer two species of animals were together the more nearly did the chemistry agree. It was easy to dis- tmguish between the blood of men and sheep, but very d,ifficult to distinguish between that of men and apes, though differences did exist.",

(Lond.), F.I.C., senior lecturer and demon- strator of chemistry, at the University Col- lege, Nottingham, was appointed professor of Chemistry in succeasion to Professor Lloyd Snape. Dr. Sudborough was edu- cated at King Edward's School, Birming- ham, where he was head boy, and subse- quently entered Mason's College, Birming- ham, where he studied for five years, gain- ing double fiQrst class honours in chemistry and geology in the B.Sc. examination of the London University. In 1891 he gained and \u00a385 Exhibition Research Scholarship, and proceeded to the University of Heidle- berg, where he worked for three years un- der the late Professor Victor Meyer. Dur- in his last year at Heidleberg, Dr. Sudbor- ough acted as one of the assistants in the University laboratories. In 1894 he was awarded an honorary research fellowship at Owen's College, Manchester, where he worked in the organic laboratory until his appointment at Nottingham in 1895. There he has given complete courses in both inor- ganic and organic chemistry, and had had the general supervision of the work in the chemical laboratories and has carried out research work with some of the more ad- vanced students. During the past ten years, Dr. Sudborough has published either conjointly conjointly or alone some 26 pa- pers containing original work. Testimon- ials which Dr. Sudborough presented from leading chemists, testify to the high qual- ity of the work which he has already pub- lished, as well as to his skill and enthusi- asm as a lecturer and teacher.",

The same cause prevented William Richard Williams from obtaining distinctions. All the candidates that tried the examination successfully passed. ThesT results, as well as those already published, clearly show that the work done in the school is thorough and cf high quality. The number of pupils in the school has also bp-on steadily increasing, so that by now the number in, the boys' school is the highest that has been re- gistered for some years.

Dr Sudborough was educated at TCirg Edward's School, Birmingham, where he was head boy and subsequently entered Mason's College, Birmingham, where he studied for five years, gainit-g double first- class honours in chemistry and geology in the B.Sc. examination of the London U L\u00ce- versity. In 1891 he gaiined an exhibition research scholarship, and proceeded to the University of Heidelberg, where he worked for three years under the late Professor Victor Meyer. During his last year at Heidelberg, Dr Sudborough acted as one of the assistants in the University laborator- ies. In 1894 he was awarded an honorary research fellowship at Owens College, Man- chester, where he worked in the organic laboratory until his appointment at Not- tingham in 1895. There he has given com- plete courses in both inorganic and organic chemistry, and has had the general super- vision of the work in the chemical labora- tories, and has carried out research work with some of the more advanced students. During the past ten years Dr Sudborough has published either conjointly or alone some twenty six papers, containing original work. Testimonials which Dr Sudborough presetted from leading chemists testify to the high quality of the work which he has already published, as well as to his skill and enthusiasm as a lecturer and teacher.",

No portion of the United Kingdom is more closely concerned than South Wales with applied chemistry, standing as it does in such vital relations to our great mining and metallurgical industries. It is strange, therefore, that, comparatively speaking, so little interest is felt locally in the subject: but, for that matter, Great Britain herself has long lagged behind, leaving Germany, France, and even Italy to get in front of her. One proof among many of this unfor- tunate state of things is found in the fact that, although the International Congress of Applied Chemistry has been in existence for almost a generation and has held its trien- nial meetings in Berlin, Paris, Rome, and elsewhere, it ha.s not yet paid a visit to Eng- land. Next year, however, this deficiency is to be made up, and the 1909 congress will take place in London. The hon. president is the venerable Sir Henry Roscoe, F.E.S., the acting-president Sir William Eamsay, F.R..S., and all the great names in British chemistry are to the front in making the congress a success. An. a,ppe\u00abl is to be made to t.he manufacturers of South Wales, espe- cially those connected with the metal- lurgical and mining industries. A local com- mittee is being formed, and Dr. E. P.

No portion of the United Kingdom is more closely concerned than South Walce with applied chemistry, standing as it does in such vital relations to our great mining and metallurgical industries. It is strange, therefore, that, comparatively speaking, aa little interest is felt locally in the subject; but, for that matter, Great Britain herself ha,s long lagged behind, leaving Germany, France, and even Italy to get in front of her. One proof among many of this unfor- tunate Sotate of things is found in the fact that, although the International Congress of Applied Chemistry has been in existence for almost a generation and has held its trien- nial meetings in Berlin, Paris, Rome, and elsewhere, it has not yet paid a visit to Eng- land. Next year, however, this deficiency is to be made up, and the 1509 congress will take place in London. The hon. president is the venerable Sir Henry Roacoe, F.R.S., the acting-president Sir William itanimy, F.R.S., and all the great names in British chemistry are to the front in making the congress a success. An appeal is to be made to the manufacturers of South Wales, espe- cially those connected with the metal- lurgical and mining industries. A local com- mittee is being formed, and Dr. E. P. Per- man, of the .University College, Oardiff, has charge of the preliminary arrangements. These could not well be in better hands, and we trust tha.t South Wales scientists will join with our C-alptains of industry in doing all they can to make the congress a Buocess.",

In 1891 he gained an 1856 Exhibities Research Scholarship, and proceeded to the University of Heidelberg, where be worked far three years under the late Professor Victor Meyer. During his last year at Heidelberg, Dr Sudborrugh acted as one of the assistants in the University laboratories. In 1894 he was awarded an Honorary Research Fellowship at OvenE College, MANCHESTER, here he worked in the organic laboratory until his appointment at Nottingham in 1895. There he has given complete courses in both inorganic and organic chemistry, and has had the general supervision of the work in the chemical laboratories and has carried out research work with some of Hle more advanced students. During the past ten years, Dr Sudborough has published either conjointly or alone some twenty-six raporsconta-ined original work. Testimonials, which Dr Sudborough presented from leading chemists, testify to the high quality of the work which he has already published, as well as to his skill and enthusiasm as a lecturer and teacher.",

One of the largest and most complete of modern educational institutions in the North of England, the 'Yorkshire College, which is situated at Leeds, and was opeued by the Prince of Wales in July last, was on Monday evening the scene of consider- able excitement and alarm, in consequence of a hre breaking out in the roof of that portion of tne building in which is situated the chemistry lecture hail and the section devoted to the study ot biology, it appears that one of the two sunlights with which the chemistry lecture-hall is lighted had been burning the greater part of the day, and that the heat from this apparatus had set fire to the false Scoring which separates the hall from the biological eeetioo above. When the hre was discovered shortly after nine o'clock, one of the professors was lecturing to a large audience in the chemistry lecture hall. The lecture was brought to an abrupt conclusion, and though it was feared that a panic might ensue, the large audience left the ball iu an orderly manner. The corporation brig<tde was soon on the spot, and the tire w&a got under at one o'clock in the morn- ing.

The chair was taken by Mr W J Morris, J.P., and there was a good attendance of the general public. The Chairman, in opening the proceedings, said be was sure that the school deserved great praise for the past year. He ako referred to the great importance of allowing children to stay in school for some length of time, instead of taking them away just as they begin to improve. The Headmaster, in his annual report, said that, in addition to the ordinary school subjects which were taught in the old buildings, they were now able to give instruccion in natural science and chemistry. Although unable to commence teaching chemistry, through delay in fitting the chemical laboratory, till the middle of the autumn term, one pupil had succeeded in passing in chemistry at the Matriculation Examination of the University of Wales. During the year Miss Owen; the head- mistress, had left the school, and he desired to ex- press his admiration of the creditable work which had been done by her. The vacancy caused by her departure had been filled by Miss Jordan Jones. Thirty candidates presented themselves at the scholarship examination and the examiner had ex- pressed himself highly satisfied with the quality of the work. The Headmaster then read the prize list, and the Chairman afterwards called upon Miss Griffith, Arianfryn, to present the prizes.",

The Governors of Abergele County Schools, as evidenced by the new appointments to the School staff, seem determined to maintain the high stan- dard of efficiency of their teachers. Mr Charles Potter, B.Sc., who has been appointed to the science mastership, has had a distinguished school and University career. At the age of 17 he won an open North Riding Yorkshire County Council Scholarship, and 31 years later took his science degree in chemistry Physics and German. After graduation he was appointed Assistant at the Welcome Chemistry Research Laboratories, London, and he has published several original re- searches in chemistry, &c., in connection with the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Societies. Miss Winifred Stythe, B.A., who has been appoin- ted Modern Languages Mistress, has also a good record of achievements. In her final Degree Cour- ses she specialised in French and English, and was appointed to a Modern Languages Travelling Ex- hibition upon the results of her College work. During her stay in France she gained the Dip'.dme Imperieur-Universit^de France-Acadtjmie deCaen for proficiency in written and conversational French. Upon her return home she went through a course of Secondary training and was subsequently placed in Class 1. for proficiency in practical teaching. From these recent appointments we have every reason to believe that Abergele County School will in the future be able to surpass even its previous brilliant records.",

One of the largest and most complete of modern educational institutions in the North of England, the Yorkshire College, which is situated at Leeds, and was opened by the Prince of Wales in July last, was on Monday evening the scene of consider- able excitement and alarm, in consequence of a tire breaking out in the roof at that portion of the building in which is situated the chemistry lecture hall and the section devoted to the study of biology. It appears that one of the two sunlights with which the chemistry lecture-hall is lighted had been burning the greater part of the day, and that the heat from this apparatus had set lire to the false flooring which sep\"rates the hall lrom the biological section above. When the tire was discovered shortly after nine o'clock, one of the professors was lecturing to a large audience in the chemistry lecture ball. The lecture was brought to an ubrupt conclusion, and though it was teared that a panic mig-ht ensue, the large audience left the ball in an orderly manner. The corporation brigade was soon on the spot, and the fire was got under at one o'clock in the morn- ing. The damage, chiefly caused by water, will be covered by insurance, but the incon- venience and loss of time caused to students will be very considerable.",

On Friday evening last, a public meeting was held in the Albert Hall, Swansea, when < the prizes and certificates gained by the suc- cessful pupils of the Central Higher Grade Board School were distributed. In the absence of Mr. Councillor David Harris, vice- Chairman of the School Board, the Rev. A. A. Mathews presided, and there were also present Alderman Richard Martin, Mr. W. S. Harris and Mr. David Roberts (members of the School Board)-, Mr. A. W. Halden (Clerk to the Board), Mr. W. Howells (one of the managers of the Higher Grade School), and Mr. S. Roberta, B.A. (head-master). The audience was larger than any that had as- sembled in the hall on previous occasions of this kind, and a better compliment could not be paid Mr. S. Roberts and Miss E. Davies (head-mistress) than that contained in the fact that in the school which they conduct with so much success there is being taken by the people a deep and increasing interest. The front of the platform had been prettily decorated, and, as in previous years, the scholars\u2014boys and girls\u2014were seated on either side of the organ. The proceedings were opened with a piano- forte solo Alice\" (Aicher), by Miss May Thomas. The choir, led by Mr. John H. Rees, one of the teachers, then gave a pleasant rendering of Hither fairies trip\"\u2014a composition by Tully well adapted to the voices of children. Miss Rachel A. Davies then sang \"Driven from Home,\" and she was followed by Master D. J. Thomas, whose sing- ing of Dr. Parry's \"Cymru Fydd, would have aroused any Welsh audience to enthusi- asm, He sang delightfully, and was loudly encored. The chairman afterwards addressed the meeting. At the outset, he regretted the absence of Dr. Morgan, and said that it would be a distinct loss to the educational world of Swansea to be deprived of such an ardent friend of education as Dr. Morgan had proved himself since he had been in this town. The speaker said a letter, regretting his inability to attend, had been received from Mr. David Harris, who. at the close of his letter, added:\u2014\" I may, however, take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the work done in the boys' department of the Central Higher Grade School during the past year, and may also state that it is the inten- tion of the Board to make the Girls' Higher Grade School an organised science school. With this object in view they have .recently appointed a highly-qualified mistress to take charge of it. So that during the next year excellent work is expected, and will, I feel sure, be secured from both departments.\" (Applause.) Letters of apology were read from Messrs. Joseph Rosser, Christopher j/ James, J. Coke Fowler, C. H. Glascodine, and Principal D. Salmon. It was pleasing to know, the chairman went on to say, that they had the sympathy of these friends of education; and he was also pleased to convey to the audience their good wishes with regard to the Higher Grade School. He was himself glad to be present to show his sympathy with the excellent work that was being done in that school, and to Evish it God-speed in the future. He congratulated the master, teachers and boys, on having at last reached their new home, and it was very gratifying to be already able to record a large increase in the number of those who attended the school. (Applause.) He found that, during the past year, nearly 100 new boys had entered the new school; and this, he thought, was a guarantee that the parents of the boys were glad that a home, worthy of their Higher Grade School, had at last been found. At present there were in the boys' department 340 boys, and 270 in the girls' department. The two departments now formed an organ- ised science sehool, which would be worked on the lines set forth in the new syllabus of the Science and Art Department. It was believed that these changes would improve the in- struction especially for girls; for, in future, less time would be devoted to science subjects, and more to literary subjects. This was not because they believed that instruction in the sciences was not important. If they were to move with the times, and occupy that prominent position among nfttjops which we have occupied in days g<?n\u00a7 bT. +hey must at- tend to the sojentii^ education of their boys. \u25a0v He was pleased to mention, with regard to the girls' department, that they had been able to appoint a new mistress in the person of Miss Phipps, B.A., of the London University, who was also to have as her lieutenant Miss Neal L.L.A., St. Andrew's University. This shewed that the members of the School Board were desirous to do everything they could to further the interests, not only of the boys, but also of the girls, in this important town; and all they asked for now was the co-operation of the parents in order that the education imparted to the children might be worthy ot the town, and bring about results that would carry gratifi- cation into the hearts of Swansea people, and those who were in charge of the schools, (Applause.) Mr. W m. Howell, a former member of the School Board, was the next to address the meeting. In the course of an interesting speech he said these schools were becoming more and more acceptable to the people. For many years a feeling prevailed that these schools were not required, and that they were not doing the sort of work which ought to ba done. At present, however, the majority of the people in this town were convinced that these schools filled the gap between the elementary and intermediate schools. There were a large number of parents in Swansea who would not be able to pay \u00a37 10s. for the education which would be given their children in the new intermediate schools; so, there- fore, he (the speaker) held that there would always be room for this school as an inter- always be room for this school as an inter- mediate one for the less wealthy part of the community. (Applause.) Another advantage claimed for higher grade and organised science schools was that the instruction was continuous with that in the elementary schools, so that when pupils passed through them to the intermediate schools, their education would be more satisfactory than when transferred from elementary schools directly to the intermediate schools. In con- clusion, Mr. Howell, stated that, from the head-master's report for last year, it appeared that one boy, Llewelyn Morgan, had earned in the way of grants, from the Science and Art Department, no less than JE16 10s. to- wards the support of the school; whilst the total amount earned by ten students of the second year was \u00a3112, giving an average of \u00a31048. per scholar. (Applause.) Mr. Howells \u2022 then distributed to the following pupils the science and art prizes awarded by the Swan- sea School Board for success in the examina- tions of the Science and Art Department:\u2014 Llewelyn Morgan, geometry, mathematics, magnetism and electricity, inorganic chemistry theoretical and practical, per- I spective Edward Phillips, geometry, mathematics, theoretical mechanics, inorganic chemistry theoretical and practical, freehand, perspective, model; Thomas A. ^Griffiths, mathematics, mechanics, magnetism and electricity, inorganic chemistry practical, M freehand, perspective and model; John L.

Baron von Liebig was born at Darmstadt on May 12th, 1803, and had, there- fore, nearly completed his 70th year. Perhaps the work by which, of all others, Baron Liebig is best known in this country is his Familiar Letters on Chemistry.\" He was also the sole author of nearly three hundred, and the joint author from thirty to forty, separate memoirs on chemical subjects which have been published from time to time in the lead- ing scientific journals at home and abroad. He co-operated with M. Poggendorf in the Dictionary of Chemistry published by him in six volumes at Brunswick, in the years 1837-1856, and in a Supplement\" to the same work in 1851-52; as also with M. Geiger in his Manual of Pharmacy. His services in the cause of science did not go unrewarded or unrecognised. In J 845 the Grand Duke of Hesse made him an here- ditary baron. He was elected foreign fellow of most of the scientific societies of Europe and Ame- rica that recognise chemistry. In 1840 he was elected to the Royal Society of Great Britain, and in 1861 he was named Foreign Associate of the Academy of Sciences at Paris. He was repeatedly invited to fill the chair of chemistry in English and Continental Universities and was per- suaded in 1852 to accept the Professorship of Chemistry in Munich, with, the position of Pre- sident of the Chemical Laboratory: In the year 1854 the sum of J61000 was raised by subscription in Europe for the purpose of presenting Liebig with a testimonial of the high esteem in which his labours were held. Of this sum \u00a3 540 was devoted to the purchase of five pieces of plate, to be severally held by the five children of Liebig; the remainder was presented to Liebig in the form of a cheque. He paid several visits to England, where his name was a hous6hold word, and took an active part in the discussion on the utilisation of sewage. His death took place at Munich on Friday afternoon.",

                "full_text": "UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF WALES, ABERYSTWYTH. At a special meeting of the Council, held on the 21st December, Miss Lilian Winstanley, B.A., was appointed assistant lecturer to Professor Herford in the department of English language and literature. Miss Winstanley, after three years' training as pupil teacher, entered Owens College, Manchester, in 1893, and in 1897 graduated as B.A. in the Victoria University with first-class honours in English language and literature. She was at the same time awarded a university scholarship under the terms of which she engaged in advanced work, and having at the close of the session 1897-8 submitted to the University an essay on the religion and philosophy of Spenser, she was elected to a university fellowship. Miss Winstanley has frequently lectured to large popular audiences on literary and other subjects. She is of Welsh extraction, being a direct descendant ofthe Rev. Benjamin Francis, a well-known Welsh hymn writer. At the same meeting Mr. Hibbert, B.Sc., and Mr. A. Brooke, Ph.D., were appointed to the post of senior and junior demonstrators in the department of chemistry. Mr. Hibbert entered Owens College in October, 1894, and in 1897 graduated as B.Se., in the Victoria University with first-class honours in chemistry and in 1897-8 pursued research work, as the results of which he was awarded the Lewis- tein exhibition in organic chemistry which he now holds. His testimonials included strong testimony as to his ability and promise as a chemist from Professors Dixon and Perkins, under whom he has specially studied at Manchester. Dr. A. Brooke pursued a course of four-and-a-half years in the chemical department of the University of Strasburg and at its close, presenting a dissert- ation embodying the results of his research work in chemistry and crystallography, obtained with distinction the degree of doctor in the university. In 1894-5 he acted as demonstrator in chemistry at the Technical College, Huddersfield, and from March 1896, to the present time has been engaged at Aberystwyth as private assistant to Professor LloyditSnape, who speaks in very high terms of his thorough acquaintance with all branches of chemical science. The professors under;whom he worked at Straaburg also bore emphatic testimony to his capacity and earnestness. 0",

Out of the 2U Honours candidates from Denbighshire plaeed ia Division A., Abergele County School claims 4, one of them being next on the list for a County Exhibition. The only candidate from Denbighshire, who passed in Welsh at the higher honours stage was also an Abergele scholar. Further successes recently credited to the school, include passes at the Matri- culation Examinations of the Universities of London and Wales, and an open exhibition at the University College of North Wales, Bangor.

Jfevill, J. S. Tregonning3, jun., and Rev. Canon Williams. All new applications, with the exception of the Morning Shr. Five Roads, were refused, and all applicants ngaiwit whcm objections were made by the police were granted, with the exception of that of Mr. Wm. Ungoed, Barley Mow, Hurry Port, which was refused. ASSAULTS.\u2014At the police-court on Wednesday, Police-constable John Thomas charged David Baraby, Thomas Jenkins, and James Thomas with assaulting Mary Phillips, David Williams, Hannah Williams, Joseph Williams, and David Aubrey. Thomas Jenkins was committed to gaol for one month with hard labour and James Thomas for 14 days with hard labour. David Baraby's case was dismissed. HOUSEBREAKING.\u2014John Lewis, of near Bryn- maen, Llannon, aged 11 years, was clJarged with entering the house of John Jones, Morlais-bridge, colliery proprietor, on the evening of Sunday last, during the absence of the inmates, and stealing therefrom a watch and 13s 6d in money. All the rooms in the house had beon ransacked. He was committed to gaol for 14 days, and then to be sent to the reformatory for two years, add Cardiff CHEMISTRY.\u2014The first of a series of lectures to be delivered on chemistry by Mr. Henry W. Read, M.A., of St. John's College, Cambridge, in con- nection with the university extension scheme, was listened to, on Wednesday evening, with much interest by a large audience, under the chairman- ship of Mr. Jonas Watson. This preliminary dis- course was open to the public free, and had reference, principally, to the history of chemistry. The lecturer sought to show conclusively that a knowledge of chemistry was beneficial to every- one; the study of chemistry trained the mind. Referring to the alchemists, he said that although many absurd and futile efforts had been made to discover the elixir vita, valuable results had accrued in other ways. The lecture was couched in concise terms, and the audience were evidently much gratified with what they had heard.",

It was also stated that no less than 40 boys were mentioned in the report of the Welsh Central Board for their work in the higher papers. Letters regretting inability to attend having been read from Dr. Isambard Owen, Principal Rhys (Oxford), Mr T. E. Ellis, M.P., Mr Bryn- mor Jones, M.P., and others, Sir JOHN LLEWELYN said he believed there was nothing more calculated to help children forward than to observe the interest taken in the work by Dr. Turpin and his admirable staff. He thought it was a perfectly fair prophecy to make that at the end of the century they would find posterity looking back upon the introduction of the tech- nical and intermediate schools in Wales as the time that science and art made the greatest step forward in the century. It was too late in the day to speak of the necessity for education. They had noticed and had seen and read about the great progress other nations were making in technical and intermediate education. They were perfectly well aware that they could not be left behind in the race, and they could only look abroad to see that foreign nations were pressing forward with that technical instruction which was going to be one of the great educa- tional characteristics of the future. He empha- sised the necessity for a little more physical education being attached to intermediate educa- tion, and said he was encouraged in doing so by the report of the Welsh Central Board to the Charity Commissioners. Sir JOHN JOES JENKINS, M.P., proposed a vote of thanks to Sir John Llewelyn for his address, tnd in doing so joined in emphasising the aecessity for technical and scientific education. Mr LLEUFER THOJIAS seconded. The motion having been carried, The mayor and mayoress were cordially thanked nl the motion of Councillor MARTIN.",

Greater practice in book work proof's would be advantageous in the higher stages. Euclid. Good. A moderate result OR paper 2 reduced an average that would have been otherwise very good.

Identities might be worked out more neatly. Latin.\u2014Very good. Most of the papers showed fair power of translation, and much greater accuracy than is usual in grammar and composition.

ALLAN GIBB, A.R.S.M. j /EXCLUSIVE TO Tl\\e Cambrian.] The Governors of the Swansea Intermediate and Technical Schools have favoured us with the following very interesting and instructive report by Mr. Gibb, one of the masters at the School:\u2014 ARTICLE II. THE ROYAL SCHOOL OF MINES.\u2014 PRIBRAM, BOHEMIA. The upper district of Bohemia, in which Pribram is situated, is rich in metalliferous mines, the greater part of which are con- trolled by the Government. The ores are mainly those of lead, but at Jaochimsthal a rich, dry silver ore is worked. The ores are smelted at the Pribram Silber und Blei Hutte,\" situate about two miles from the town. These smelting works are arranged on the most modern lines and form an excellent type for the student to study. The school is not very centrally situated for other metallurgical districts, but these are readily reached from Prague. The mining and metallurgical industries of Austria are very interesting and presents many points of great importance to the student. Iron is extracted in considerable quanti- ties in Upper Bohemia. The ores of silver, gold, mercury and lead are found and treated in Bohemia, Salzburg and Carinthia. Tin is found and extracted at Graupen, in Bohemia- THE SCHOOL OF MINES. The Bergakadamie consists of two build- ings some distance apart. The laboratories for chemistry and metallurgy are situated in the newer of the buildings, the original j building being mainly occupied by the mining lecture rooms and collections. The collection of models of mining appli- ances is comprehensive. There are no metallurgical models. For instruction in mining there is a good collection of specimens illustrative of economic geology. In the newer building there is a collection of both petrographic palseontological geological specimens. The collection of crystallised minerals is good. The laboratories for chemistry are of the usual type, the benches and appliances being such as are usually found in English schools. There is a small room for furnace and special combustion work, but there is no metallurgical laboratory. The mining and metallurgical students take a series of preliminary courses (Allge- meine Abtheilung), which last two years. and in which they receive a general scientific training. In the third year they specialise in whichever branch they may choose. The chemical and metallurgical training of the first two years is mainly imparted by means of lectures. A course of lectures on general chemistry is delivered four hours weekly throughout the first year, and a similar course on metallurgy is delivered j during the second year. During the second year there is also a course of lectures on experimental chemistry and assaying, including qualitative analysis and the various branches of quantitative analysis. The practical work of the .Allgemeine; Abtheilung\" is done in the second year, occupying six hours weekly during the winter term and eight hours weekly during the summer term. This course consists of experimental chemistry and qualitative analysis. In the third year the metallurgical student [ attends lecturea on metallurgy, which are divided into two parts. The first course, I which is delivered on three hours weekly, treats of the metals other than iron, and the second, which occupies five hours weekly, treats of the metallurgy of iron and steel, y There is also a course on metallurgical machinery and construction, in connection with which there is a class for teaching practical designing of metallurgical ap- pliances. During the third year ten hours weekly are given to practical work in the laboratory, the work being mainly the quantitative analysis of ores and metallurgical products. THE TECHNICAL SCHOOL, AIX-LA-CHAPELLE. The Technical School at Aix-la-Chapelle has an excellent metallurgical department, and attendance at this school may form part of the training necessary to qualify for service in the Government mines and works. Many of the most modern of the German \u25a0 iron and steel works are found in this locality, and at Stolberg, Mechnik, &c., there, are interesting works in which lead and silver ores are smelted. The numerous metallurgical works of Belgium are also within easy reach. Xo attempt is made to teach metallurgy by the method practised at Clausthal and Frei- berg, but excursions to the works in the neighbourhood form an important part of the training. Some work is also done in a metal- lurgical experimenting laboratory. The Technical School consists of a group of buildings which have been built at successive periods as the demand for accom- modation increased. The laboratories for metallurgy and applied chemistry are situated at the back of the principal building, and the general chemical laboratories are in a newer building to the right, j Thtf students attend the school for four years, diiruig which period they receive a thorough scientific training, and specialise in one of a series of subjects. The training for the diploma of Metal- lurgical Engineer (Hutten Ingenieure) is very comprehensive, embracing mathematics, mechanics\u2014pure and applied, physics, mining and chemistry, besides the several branches of metallurgy. There are two sets of laboratories for practical chemistry, one being used for organic chemistry, and the other for inorganic and general analytical chemistry. With the latter there is a laboratory used entirely for electrochemical work, which, under the direction of Professor Classon, is particularly well taught in this school. These laboratories are fitted in a most complete manner, being provided with every possible appliance necessary for the various branches of chemical teaching and research. There is an excellent collection of chemical preparations for illustrating the lectures. There is a third chemical laboratory, used for teaching chemical technology, in another building. This laboratory is older than the others, and is not so elaborate in its fittings, r, but it is thoroughly well equipped for the purpose for which it is used. There is a good collection of specimens illustrating the various branches of applied chemistry. The teaching of chemistry in the first year is done entirely by lectures, which are divided into several courses. During the winter term there is a course on general experimental chemistry, occupying six hours weekly, which is followed, during the summer term, by a course on the chemistry of the metals. This latter course includes an introduction to the study of electrochemistry and chemical analysis. There is a further course during the summer term on experimental organic 1chemistry. In the second year the student attends lectures and works in the laboratories. Lectures are given, during the summer term, on chemical technology. These lectures form part of a more comprehensive course on this subject, which is undertaken, in its complete form, only by the students in chemistry, and which is so divided that the metallurgical students attend lectures on those subjects only which will have a direct bearing upon their future work. During the winter term there is a course of lectures, occupying one hour weekly, upon the methods of volumetric analysis. The practical work during this year occupies four hours weekly, and deals with the analysis of mineral substances. There are two laboratories for practical metallurgy, and in connection with these are a balance room and a store room. One laboratory is equipped with numerous furnaces of various forms which are mainly used for metallurgical experimenting. These include a small furnace in which the puddling\" of iron may be practised. The power aDd blast necessary for the various operations are derived from a small steam engine which drives a Root's blower. The second laboratory is fitted for analytical work, and contains several small wind furnaces, which are very convenient and compact. They consist of a sheet iron shell mounted on legs, and lined with refractory material so as to just leave room for one crucible. These furnaces take up very little room and burn either coal or charcoal. The temperature attained in them is equal to that in the larger furnaces usually found in i assaying laboratories. There is a good collection of metallurgical specimens, but there are no models of appliances. There is also a collection of plans and diagrams of furnaces, &c. The metallurgical teaching begins in the second year, when the student attends lectures on general metallurgy, which occupy three hours weekly during the summer term. The third year is almost entirely devoted to the study of the various branches of metal- lurgy. A course of lectures, occupying six hours weekly, is given on the metallurgy of 11 Y the metals other than iron. The metallurgy of iron and steel is taught in a course of lectures which occupy six hours weekly during the summer term, and these are followed by a course on iron and steel manufacture, de- livered four hours weekly, during the summer term. There is a practical course in which the design of metallurgical appliances is taught. This course occupies three hours weekly throughout the year. Practical assaying is taught by lectures and in the laboratories throughout the year the laboratories being open for this purpose six hours weekly during the winter term and four hours weekly during the summer term. Lectures on assaying are given during part of the time, and during the remainder the student carries into practice the methods taught, Three hours during this year are devoted to lectures and laboratory work on blowpipe analysis. The fourth year is entirely given up to metallurgical research, and practical work in the various laboratories. THE TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL, DARMSTADT. In the Darmstadt Technical School there is no attempt at systematic metallurgical teach- ing, that subject occupying a subordinate place in the chemical curriculum. The chemical department of this school is one of the newest and best equipped in Europe, and presents many points of interest. The school consists of three buildings, two smaller buildings having been erected oppo- site the larger and principal building. One of the smaller buildings is occupied by the o laboratories for physics and electro-technics, and the other by those for pure and applied chemistry. The general chemical laboratories are most commodious, and have been equipped with all modern appliances, both for inorganic and organic chemistry. No expense has been spared in the equipment of these laboratories; which are probably the finest of their kind in I the world. The laboratories for electro-chemistry and general applied chemistry are in the same building, and are also excellent both in their accommodation and equipment. In the former, each bench is provided with electric leads from the accumulators, and there is an elaborate arrangement for adjusting the cur- rent to meet the requirements of the various experiments. All the most recent appliances, including electrical furnaces, are found in this laboratory. The current is supplied from a large battery of accumulators in a room beneath the laboratory. The accumulators are charged from the electric lighting plant in the principal building. There are three courses in chemistry, each of which extends over four years. These are intended for students of general electro and pharmaceutical chemistry respectively. The first two years are occupied by a general scientific training in which chemistry ia treated only in its main outlines. The third and fourth years are almost entirely devoted to the various branches of chemistry all of which are treated in a most eompre- hensive manner, both in the lectures and in the laboratories. ROYAL SCHOOL OF MINES, LONDON. The training for the diploma of the Roya School of Mines, London, occupies three years. During the first two years the student receives a general scientific training, attending lectures and working in the laboratories at the various branches of science which are connected with metal- lurgy. In the third year he selects either mining or metallurgy as the subject in which he desires to take the diploma, and during the year devotes himself entirely to this special study. I The preliminary courses include chemistry, physics, mechanics and geology with mineralogy, and these courses are so arranged that the student takes only one at the same time, each course lasting half a school year. Instruction is given in mathe- matics throughout the whole three years if necessary. LECTURES AND LABORATORIES. CHEMISTRY.\u2014There are three laboratories in which chemistry is taught. Two of these are used for general chemistry, the third being reserved for the advance courses necessary for those students who intend taking the diploma of the Royal College of Science in chemistry. The general laboratories are, together, capable of accommodating about 150 students. The working benches, one of which is assigned to each student, are provided with cupboards and drawers, and have double rows of shelves for re-agents. There are a number of draught cupboards for ordinary use, and others for the more accurate operation of quantitative analysis. In connection with each laboratory there is a combustion room and a balance room. The sulphuretted hydrogen is generated in the basement of the college, and is conveyed to the labora- tories through pipes ending in a number of delivery tubes, each of which is contained in a small draught chamber.

M.P., presided over a meutmg of wi# Council ot the University (Jollego of Wales, Abtirystwytn, on Friday, when the principal business on the agenda was the appointment of professors in Weku a-nd chemistry. Particular interest has been taken in the appointment to tho Coitic chair, in succession to the lata Sir Ed. Anwyl. Mr. Timothy Lewis and Mr. Parry Williams, who lecturers in the Welsh Depar-ment, were interviewed. It is understood that the Advisory Board recommended the appointment of Mr Parry Williams, whose appointment however, waa objected to by the Comrades of the Great War on the ground that lie was a conscien- tious objector, anj that Mr. Lewis has served with thiJ army in France. Aft41. prolonged discussion, which revealed strong feeling and divergence of opinion, tha Council decided to postpone the appointment until the end of the Session in June next. In the meantime the Council presumed that both Mr. Parry Williams and Mr. Timothy Lewis con- tinue to carry on the work during the session until the permanent appointment is made. DISTINGUISHED CHEMISTRY PROFESSOR Mr. B. Mouat Jones was appointed professor of chemistry, in succession to Prof. Findlay. Educated at Dulwich College and Balliol Col- lege, he graduated B.A. in 1S05 and M.A. iu 1909. He is thirty-six years of age. From 1905 to 1906 he was research assistant in min- eralogical chemistry at the Imperial Institute, London, and from 1906 to 1912 was professor of chemistry a;t. the Government College, Lahore, India, and from 1913 he was assistant professor of chemistry at the Imperial College of Science and Technology, London. In Sep- tember, 1914 he joined the London Scottish as a private. In 1915 he was captain and assist- ant director at the Central Laboratory, G.H.Q., France; in 1918 he was promoted major; and from December, 19^8, to June. 1919, he held the rank of liutenant-colonel and was director of the Central Laboratory. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and was three times mentioned in despatches. At the Cen- tral Laboratory he was in charge of all the chemical work and dealt with defence against poisonous gasses and with the systematic in* vestigation of all materials used by the enemy in chemical warfare. The Council agreed to consider the position of Dr T C. James, lecturer in chemistry, with the view of improving his status. ACCOMMODATION ACQUIRED. The Registrar (Mr J H. Davios) renortfcd with refn-ence to the re-opening of the College on Tuesday that arrangements had been made for the accommodation of the large number of students experled by the purchase of the Cam- brian Plate Works amd the leasing of rooms at the Th'eological College anj at St. Michael's Parish Hall for the session.",

                "full_text": "The Daily Telegraph m -ikes the following observations upon the Baron's dis .inguuhed career :\u2014 Baron Justus von Liebig died at Munich on Friday last, in bis seventieth year. His claimsto be considered the f ither of applied chemistry are indisputable. As Socrates \"brought philosophy down from Heaven and made her discourse in the market-place,\" so did Liebig drag chemistry forth from the laboratory and make her labour to cheapen our food, to lengthen our days, to bless our fiddi and crops, and to fill our garners with all manner of store. At the early age of twenty he was a consummate master of, and original explorer in the domain of organie chemistry, a.nd his paper on fulminic acid and the fulminates, written in 1823, gained him the friendship of Humbolt and the Professorship of Chemistry at G-iessen. From that day Liebig devoted himself exclusively to original chemical research. Never, probably, was there a scientific man so thoroughly imbued with the spirit of the Novum Organon, or so fully resolved to master the secrets of Nature, and so to make her the handmaid of man. The spirit of his labours is no- where more apparent than in his\" Familiar Letters on Chemistry\"\u2014a book which is to be found in almost every English household, and which is a model of lucidity and conciseness. But the greafcst test of the worth of Liebig's discoveries is that thousands benefit by them who have never heard his name. Liebig's extract of meat\" is, it is true, known from Antipodes to Antipodes. But to Liebig are also due almost all of those im- provements in agriculture which have led to the modern methods of high farming, and he was the first to give a scientific expression aud definite value to such o d rules as those which bear on the rotation of crops, and the importance of letting each corn field have back its own straw. He was also the first to apply chemistry to dietetics and cookery, and to teach u< that without some knowledge of scienca not even a leg of mutton can be properly boiled, or a dish of vegetables pro- perly dressed. Lastly, it is mainly to his re searches that we are indebted for our modern system of ma=n drainage and sewage utilisation. He was, indeed, the first to teach us to give back to the land what we take from it, and to warn us that the nation which empties its sewage into the sea is guilty of waste as reckless as if it deliberately fired its forests and coal mines. Crotchets the great chemist had, it is true and some of his theories he pushed to an extreme length. Nor will his name, perhaps, be handed down a'ong with those of Priestley, Cavendish, and Fa.ra- d iy but the number of his difcoveri-s can hardly be counted, nomn their importance possibly be over- estimated. He stands, indeed, to chemistry much as Watt stands to mechanics. He caught Ariel, prisoned him, and made him work for man and iu a ripe old age he parsed away, not before he had seen his dreams realised and his hopes fulfilled.",

It is a strong bridge, and residents both sides of the river are delighted with it. The Council also has had the lower bridge on covers' Lane repaired, which is a great boon to those who frequent the new roads through Ailtfach, which were recently made. and are admired by all. THE OOUNTY SCHOOL. The County School re-opened on the 20th inst. The new pupils number about 30. There are now 80 pupils on the register. The Central Welsh Board results this year have eclipsed all previous successes, and re- xlect great credit on the Headmaster and his staff. The new work-room for manual instruction has been well-equipped, and the tools, etc., have been very orderly arranged. To meet the additional requirements of the educational authorities, an extra teacher is sorely needed, and we sincerely hope that the governors will soon endeavour to procure such.

                "full_text": "JThe Daily Telegraph nukes the following observations upon the Baron's distinguished career :\u2014 Baron Justus von Liebig died at Munich on Friday last, in his seventitth year. His claims to be considered the father of applied chemistry are indisputable. As Socrates \"brought philosophy down from Heaven and made her discourse in the market-place,\" so did Liebig drag chemistry forth from the laboratory and make her labour to cheapen our food, to lengthen our days, to bless our fields and cropt, and to fill our garners with all manner of store. At the early age of twenty he was a consummate master of, and original explorer in the domain of organic chemistry, and his paper on fulminic acid and the fulminates, written in 1823, gained him the friendship of Humbolt and the Professorship of Chemistry at Giessen. From that day Liebig devoted himself exclusively to original chemical research. Never, prebably, was there a scientific man \"'eI thoroughly imbued with the spirit of the Novum Organon, or so fully resolved to master the secrets of Nature, and so to make her the handmaid of man. The spitit of his labours is no- where more apparent than in his \"Familiar Letters on Chemistry \"\u2014a book which is to be found in almost every English household, and which is a model of lucidity and conciseness. But the greatest test of the worth of Liebig's discoveries is that thousands benefit by them who have never heard his name. Liebig's extract of meat\" is, it is true, known from Antipodes to Antipodes. But to Liebig are also due almost all of those im- provements in agriculture which have led to the modem methods of high farming, and he was the first to give a scienti6c expression and definite value to such old rules as those which bear on the rotation of crops, and tbe importance of letting each corn field have back its own straw, tte was also the first to apply chemistry to dietetics and cookery, and to teach that without some knowledge of science not even a leg of mutton ean be properly boiled, or a dish of vegetables pro- perly dressed. Lastly, it is mainly to his re searches that we are indebted for our modern system of man drainage and sewage utilisation. He was, indeed, the first to teach us to give back to the land what we take from it, and to warn U8 that the nation which empties its sewage into the sea is guilty of waste as reckless aa if it deliberately fired its forests and eoal mines. Crotchets the great chemist had, it is true \u2022 and some of his theories he pushed to an extreme length. Nor will his name, perhaps, be handed down along with those of Priestley, Cavendish, and Fara- day but the number of his discoveries can hardly be counted, nor can their importance possibly be over- estimated. He stands, indeed, to chemistry much as Watt stands to mechanics. He caught Ariel, prisoned him, and made him work for man and in a ripe old age he passed away, not before he had seen his dreams realised and his hopes fulfilled.",

Miss Sarah E. Matthews, Treorchy, has attended the school for three years, and is now only 14 years of age. Her father is a collier, and, like many other working men in the Rhondda., is determined to sacrifice something to give his daughter Miss S. E. MAT'TlIEWS.\" a good education. To be the head of a list of over 600 successful candidates, and to obtain distinctions in six subjects, is a very good beginning. Bessie is a favourite with all, and her work does not press heavily on her, as she is of a cheerful disposition, is in good health, and takes an earnest interest in her studies. She intends becoming a teacher, and it is tolerably- certain that, if she maintains the same standard of efficiency, she will in a few years occupy an honourable posi- tion in the teaching profession.",

                "full_text": "Porth Boys' County School. Annual Distribution of Prizes and Certificates. The prizes and certificates awarded to the pupils of Porth Boys' County School Oil the examination results for 1915, \u00bb'ere dis- tributed un Tuesday evening last, at Tabernacle kE.B.) Chapel, Porth, by the Right Hon. William Abraham (Mabon), M.P. After the singing of the hymn, \u2022'O Arglwydd Dduw,\" by the School Choir, the chairman, Dr. \\V. E. Thomas, M.D., J.P., addressed the meetiing, pointing out in a few well chosen words, that Mabon, in attending the meeting, was making what was almost his first public appearance after his long and serious illness. He pointed out the great honour which Mr. Abraham had attained in becoming a member of the Privy Council, and thoug.il that a portion of the honour was reflected on the School. The song Pimpinella (Tchaikowsky), was then rendered by the School Choir of junior boys, in excellent style, after which the headmaster, Mr. E. Samuel, M.A., proceeded to deliver his report of the school work for the preceding year. in the course oi his speech Mr. Samuel dwelt upon the excellent work of the staff, and the magnificent examination results ob- tained, the upper portion of the school especially, having done exceedingly well. Two boys, Ivor A. Williams and William Hellings, had obtained County Scholar- ships of the value ot t45 per annum, for three or four years, and the former boy had received notification from the authorities of Jesus College, Oxford, that he was within a few marks of the boy who had won a scholarship at that college, of the value of JE:80 per annum for four years. With regard to the Staff there had been two changes. Mr. Redlearn, M.Sc., had joined the staff in January, and Mr. Lewis, B.A., had left at the end of July to join the Army for the period of the war. His place had been filled, temporarily, by Mr. Williams. Mr, Samuel was pleased to state that all members of the staff of military age had enlisted under Lord Derby's scheme, to come up for mititary service when called upon. Mr. Samuel then proceeded to contrast the British educational system and the German, and to show the terrible effects of militarism as taught in German elemen- tary schools. He pointed out that under our system a boy has a general education until he reaches the age of 16, and then specialises for two years before leaving the secondary school. In Germany the pupil specialises from a very early age, chiefly in modern languages, but in almost evecy ease better results are obtained under the British system. This speech, delivered in Mr. Samuel's usual capable fashion, was greeted with great applause. It was followed by an ex- cellent violin solo Le Reve, executed by Albert E. (Teddy) Smith in a very creditable manner. Mr. \\vTliiam Abraham then proceeded to distribute the cenifieatesand prizes, after delivering a short speech. He bad a message for both the staff and the boys, asking neither to be satisfied with their previous work, but to g(, oii, and climb higher and higher. They boys, he said, were being helped on now hy external aid perhaps, but after reaching a certain stage it would be by their own powers alone that they could climb. They were now being given the opportunity to conserve and build up their powers for the final unaided efforts. In a very humorous manner Mabon appealed to those present to forgive his use of notes for reference during his speech; it v.;ls embarassing to him, he said, to use them, but it was absolutely necessary. The distribution of the prizes was fol- lowed by the rendering of a Scout Song,\" by a party of junior boys dressed in the picturesque scout uniform, the chorus being sung by the School Choir. This was followed by the recitation of The Newsboy's Debt,\" a pathetic piece delievered in a style that commanded per- fect silence, and brought a tear to more than one eye. A perfect roar of applause broke out, and continued until Clifford Roberts, the juvenile elociftionist, re- turned. He then recited a humorous piece, Boys' Rights,\" which was so de- livered that frequently Clifford could not be heard by reason of the roars uf laughter he occasioned. There is no doubt that the boy will become one of our premier elocu- tionists when he grows up. He was again applauded for some time, but the chair- man was forced, on account of time, to proceed with the programme. The thanks of the assembly, proposed by Mrs. Mary Griffiths, Maes Gwyn, Cymmer, and seconded by Mrs. Florence Nicholas, the Garth, Trealaw, were unanimously signified to Mr. Abraham for the way in which he had performed his share in the ceremony. Mabon acknowledged the thanks in a neat speech, and thanked those present for the way in they had greeted him. Unfortunately, he was un- able to remain-during the rest of the pro- gramme, owing to important business. The next item was the singing of the Welsh Airs, \"Llwyn Onn and Rhyfel- gyreh Cadben Morgan,\" by the School Choir. This was followed by a vote of thanks to the chairman, proposed by Alderman Morgan Williams, J.P., and seconded by Councillor Mark Harcomur. The very successful meeting was bruoght to a close by the singing of the Welsh and English National Anthems, the former being sung by Alun Davies, Form V. Great praise is due to Mr. David Jones, M.I.S.M., for the excellent singing of the School Choir, trained by him. PRIZES AWARDED BY SIR WILLIAM JAMES THOMAS, YNYSHIR.

The\" Linnean is a scientific society of the highest rank, having for its object the cultivation of the science 'of natural history in all its branches (botany, zoology, &c.) It was founded in the year! 1788, and incorporated by Royal Charter in the year 1802. and its Fellowship is considered a very high honour ,which is much prized and coveted. Mr Evans, who is well known as a most successful schoolmaster and science teacher, has made botany in all its branches, the subject of prolonged and special study, and from the list of Fellows he is the only elemeutary teacher in Wales holding this distinction. It must be very gratifying to Mr Evans, who has done so much to spread a knowledge of botany, to find his labours so richly rewarded, and although botany is his forte, yet he has not neglected the stady of other sciences, as he holds the necessary qualifications to teach five other sciences besides botany, viz., physiology, agriculture. hygiene, theoretical inorganic chemistry, and practical inorganic chemistry and when it is borne in iniad that the minimum qualification to teach, that at present satisfies the Science and Art Department, is a first class in the advanced stage, the value of the above will at once be evident. On two occasions Mr Evans was selected to attend the courses for science teachers at the Normal School of Science, South Kensington, where he attended a botany course in 1886, conducted by Prof. D. H. Scott, M.A., Ph.D., F.L.S., and an agriculture and agricultural chemistry course in 1838, conducted by Prof. Wrightson, M.R.A.C., F.C.S., and Mr Chap- man Jones, F.C.S., F.I.C., and eacn time he got a first class.",

In elementary practical inorganic chemistry three students, James F. Thomas, Delia Davies, and Lillie Lewis, each got first class, and Medora Lloyd, Gertrude L. Kemp, Evan T. Jones, Albert H. Kemp, and Jane M. Jones, second class. In advanced practical inorganic chemistry Maglona M. Rees, Paris House, received first class. In ele- mentary theoretical chemistry there were ten first classes, Louis J. Williams, Albert H. Kemp, Lillie Lewis, Pollie Thomas, Medora Llovd, Delia Davies, James E. Thomas, Bridget D. Roberts, Robert T. Edwards, Corris, and Laura Pugh; second class, Jane M. Jones, Margaret A. Lewis, Gertrude L. Kemp, George E. Owen, and Mary H. Edwards. The committee has been reinforced by the addition of a number of ladies, and four of these- Mrs. (Dr.) Williams, Mrs. Lloyd, Bank Place, Miss N. Foulkes Jones, and Miss Humphreys took an active part in either visiting the classes or in superintending the examinations, under the direction of the secretary Mr. E. Ll. Evans. 31aclivulletb being a town of less than 5,000 inhabitants the Science and Art De- partment's grants will this year be received under the old scale, but next year all science classes will come under the new regulations, and in future no grant will be paid by the Science Department for sccond class pass in the elementary stage of any science subject. The effect of this regulation will probably be to reduce the grants for elementary work in science by one half.",

The chemistry of love is based upon the law of atomic affinities. A chemical change is brought about by atoms of differ- ent sorts rushing together, or \"combining,\" as a chemist would say, to produce new sub- stance. In chemistry the idea of male and female is associated with plus and minus electricity. A man is a grouped association of atoms with an electric charge of plus potential. A woman is another grouped association of atoms with an electric charge of minus potential. The man need not al- ways be necessarily plus nor the woman minus, for the electric signs oscillate to and fro.

Lloydd read a paper on The Chemistry of Ensilage before the applied chemistry and physics section of the Society of Arts, Julm-street, Adelphi, London, the chair being occupied by Lord Thurlow. The lecturer commenced by observing that it was im- possible to say at what period of the world's history the custom of storing food in the ground originated but it seemed certain that holes in the ground were originally used to preserve grain unchanged long be- fore any buildings were constructed for that purpose. Out of this custom the modern form of preserving food m properly constructed receptacles, called silos, had arisen. When any green vegetables was cut and allowed to lie on the ground damp, by the action of oxygen in the air, it decayed; but if placed in an atmosphere devoid of oxygen, then as it could not oxidise it did not decay. If a crop was carted to a silo as it was cut its vital functions would continue. Hence the first changes which took place in the silo were those due to the natural growth of the plant cell. The lecturer then traced in a most minute manner the various chemical changes that take place in a silo, and supported Mr. George Fry, who laid down the following conditions for the production of \"sweet\" silage, which necessitated a dry substance, an excess of oxygen, and a temperature above 122 degrees Fahrenheit, that the substance when placed in the silo should not contain more than 75 per cent. of moisture, must be in active and mature growth; and, lastly, that the silo should be filled slowly. In conclusion, the lecturer remarked that for fattening animals there was no proof of silage being either in- ferior or superior to the usual winter feed of hay and roots, but for cows in milk undoubtedly the evidence on all sides was in favour of sour silage. The paper was followed by an animated discussion.",

Donnelly, Sir J. Crichton Browne, Sir H. Truman Wood, Mr T. H. Elliott, C.B.. and many representatives of British and foreign learned societies. Lord Brampton declared that he was as ignorant of chemistry as the babe unborn, but he had lived long enough to know the value of the institution What he had heard had shown him that it would be profitable for all infants if they could be born with a perfect knowledge of chemistry. (Laugh- ter.) Then they would know the elements of the particular condensed milk on which they were fed, and could say if it agreed with them, and as life advanced they could say whether the soothing syrup administered by the nurse suited their constitution, and what its effect would be. (Renewed laughter.) In middle age the student would know the best thing to take to cure the restlessness of the muscles of the legs that pre. vented him making his way home. (Laughter.) But the older men grew the more ignorant they grew as to what was good for them and even if he applied to Dr. Stevenson, be would probably say that he did not fully know his constitution, and back to the soothing syrup age he would have to go. Even the chemist could not with cer- tainty make him young again.",

The London press announces that a committee has been formed for the purpose of raising a per- manent record of the services to chemistry in its relation to medicine and pharmacy of Professor Theodore Redwood, of London. Dr. Redwood is & son of the late Mr. Thos. Redwood,of Boverton,Cow- bridge, and a brother of the late Dr. Lewis Red- wood, surgeon to the Rhymney Ironworks, and of the late Mrs. Charles Vachell, of Cardiff. Dr. Redwood is one of the first authorities of the day on all chemical questions, and his services are eagerlv requisitioned in intricate analytical cases. He has been Professor of Chemistry to the Phar- maceutical Society since 1842, and has also held tha officfi of president of the society, but the high position and reputation which he has gained are in great measure due to the services which he has rendered to medicine and pharmacy as one of the editors of the British Pharmacopeia. Dr. Redwood is about to retire from the Professorship, which he has held for close upon half a century, and' it has been determined that this affords a fitting occasion for doing something to perpetuate a record of his eminent services both to the society and to science. The committee formed for this purpose includes the names of the present presi- dent of the Phamaceutical Society, the president of the Royal College of Physicians (Sir William Jenner, Bart.), the President of the General Medical Council (Sir Henry Acland), the president of the Chemical Society (Dr. Hugo Miiller), the president of the Institute of Chemistry (Professor Odling), Sir William Gull, Sir Spencer Wells, Bart., Sir George Burrows, Dr. Quain, Dr.' Garrod, Sir Frederick Abel, Sir Henry Roscoe, Professor Falk- land, and a nnmber of other eminent physicians and scientists.",

No portion of the Undted Kingdom is more closely concerned than South Wales with applied ohemistry, standing ae it does in suoh vital relations to our great mining and metallurgical industries. It is strange, therefore, that, comparatively speaking, so little interest;s felt locally in the subject; but, for that matter. Great Britain herself has lone lagged behind, leavinsr Germamv. France, erkd even Italy to get in front of her. One proof among many of this unfor- tunate state of things is found in the fact that, although the IuternaTfoihaJ Congress of Applied Chemistry has been in existence for almost a generation and has held its trien- nial meetings in Berlin, Paris, Rome, and elsewhere, it has not yet poid a visit to Eng- lajid. Next year, however, this deficiency is to be made up, and the 1909 congress will take place in London. The hon. president is the venerable Sir Henry Roscoe, F.R.S., the acting-president Sir William Ramsay, F.R.B., and all the great names in British chemistry are to the front in making the congress a success. An app-eal is to be made to the manufacturers of South Wales, espe- cially those connected with the metal- lurgical and mining industries. A local oom- mittee is being formed, &nd Dr. E. P. Per- man, of the University CoHege, OardifT, h\" oh.arge of the preliminary arra-n?emen?! These could not well be in better hande, and we trust that South We-les scientists willl join with our caoprtains of industry in doing! all they can to make the congress a gpcoeee.",

                "full_text": "THE FLINTSHIRE TECHNICAL CLASSES. MR. VAUGHAN HUGHES' REPORT UN THE CHEMISTRY LECTURES. PRIZE WINNERS IN THE HOLYWELL CLASS. The following interesting report on the course of popular lectures on chemistry given by Mr. Vaughan Hughes, has been submitted to the Joint Education Committee. To the Committee en Technieml Instruction of the Flintshire County Council. TXB FOPULAB LECTURES ON CHEMISTRY. Gentlemen,\u2014In compliance with your request I have pleasure in making my report on the result of the popular lectures on chemistry, I had the honor of delivering at Holy well, Flint, and Buckley, and which were brought to a close last April, The subject matter of the 12 lectures was chosen with a view to showing the utility of Chemistry in every day life, its bearing on the manufacturing industries of Flintshire, on agriculture, domestic economy and household sanitation. With such a view in mind and the twelve hours at my disposal for the purpose, any attempt to treat the subject from a \"teaching and examining\" point of view would have been unwarrantable and especially so in the absence of any results of previous lectures on Chemistry which may have been given, but of which I have no information. J-udging from the marked attention and the good average attendances of the students at the three classes (and especially of those at Buckley), I gather that the lectures have been highly appreciated. Ample testimony of the great interest in the subject is afforded by the numerous questions put to me by students respecting chemical changes observed by them to take place during the manufacture of some of the staple products of Flintshire. These questions were, I am pleased to be able to state of such a nature that those who put them must have felt that a knowledge of the chemical properties of substances could materially assist them in their daily avocations. The largest average attendance was at Buckley, I do not think I had less than 60 on any one occasion. Holywell follows in point of members, and Flint much behind. Those however who attended ar. the last named place were fairly regular and learnt, it is hoped, that even a labourer in a che nioal works ought to know something of the properties of the substances he handles both for his own and bis employers' welfare. All students who have attended these preliminary lectures, will, I trust be better able to grasp and ap-praciato-the- science of Chemistry in a systematic fourse next session. Of the several note books received from the students in competition for the prize you requested me to announce would be awarded at the close of the lectures to the writer of the mast complete record of the lectures, I consider that of Mr. Gwilym E. Oliver, Holywell, the best, and in order of excellence those of Messrs. David Hughes, Holywell, and John Jones, Soughton, of equal merit. A word of praise is due to Mr. Oliver for his concise statement of the facts put before the classes. I must not fail however to allude to the attempts of Messrs. Ernest Jones and John Jones, of Buckley, whose note books give evidence of promise and great painstaking. Few have attempted sketches, and I would here point out that some of the students would have saved themselves much trouble if they had neatly sketched the apparatus employed instead of relying upon pages of written description. Future students should recognize the fact that a knowledge of drawing is fundamental in techno- logical work, apart from its aid in developing the mind. In the science and art examinations bad sketches are unfavourable to a high pI Lce on the list of successful candidates, and often to a pass. Without drawing it is often almost impossible to answer many of the questions set in a paper in the allotted space of time. Recognizing then the attendances and the general state of the note books received, I think, gentlemen, you are to be congratulated upon the results of the preliminary lectures on Chemistry, more so because it most not be forgotten that many of those attending them had previously no idea of the scope or meaning of chemical knowledge. In proportion as the usefulness of Chemistary becomes known, and the commercial results of its numerous applications are appreciated this branch of the exact sciences will receive the attention it deserves, and donbtless next session there will be well attended classes in elementary Chemistry in Flintshire.\u2014I remain, &c., T. VAUGHAN HUGHEB. Greenfield, Holywell, June 24th, 1891.",

SIR,-The atatements made by Professor Angus t o Aberystwyth meeting, contained in a report which It appears had the benefit of his revision, were as fc$\u00b0 \u2014\" It was only fair to say that the Bangor staff attempt to do the work done at Aberystwyth ,fi He did not believe they attempted honours Chemistry, or he believed in the other science deP^ ments.\" cttU. The plain meaning of these words seems to o0 according to Professor Angus's belief no work is doI> g) Bangor by way of preparation of students for hononr jg, chemistry or in other science departments. The i nevertheless, that honours have been won by students in chemistry as well as in other science suw^t Professor Angus now assures us that what he to was say that no honours teaching work in jW* courses\" is given at Bangor in chemistry or in the science departments. Heferring to the calnnHnrs of two colleges for session 1889-90, I find that the ments for honours classes in physics at Bango'urf practically the same as those at Aberystwyth, In BO special classes are held for honours students at ystwyth, but we are informed that the advanced are more particularly designed for honours in th0 London examinations (intermediate science exA tot liminary scientific) and pass B.Sc. Precisely arrangements exist at Bangor. Ad It is clear, therefore, that putting the interpretJ upon his words which Professor A ngus asks for, W* I stall erroneous so far as other science concerned. At all events they are without because no teaching work in lecture courses\" '9 at Aberystwyth which is not also done at Bangor. j Coming now |to the arrangements for instruct\u00bb\u00b0%t honours in chemistry at the two Colleges, I find MP while honours in the B.Sc. examination have been by one Bansror student since 1884 and by one ystwyth student since 1872, no special teaching., iK in lecture courses\" is announced in connection wi^ tdt examination at either College. It i8> therefore, ^{0 again that Professor Angus's remarks do not apP\" the higher classes in the chemistry department, but to the lower or intermediate classes and it also apP^f# that honours\" work at Aberystwyth does not imply teaching* work in lecture courses.\" Had fessor Angus said the professor of chemistry at doesnot hold a special lecture course for honours stfl^W in connection with the intermediate examination University of London,\" his words would have literally correct; butjthe statement would still hav0 w entirely misleading. jjs Candidates for honours at the intermediate scl tfp examination in chemistry are not required to # extra subjects; they are merely required to fuller knowledge of the subjects prescribed for tb0 examination than is expected of ordinary candi^> The separation of intermediate students into cla\u00bbs\u00abV therefore, amere matter of convenience With to minimize as far as possible the evils attending sub-divlV of classes and in order to afford to all interD>eClof 1 students the opportunity of learning something the subject than is required for a bare pass, the of the professor of chemistry at Bangor has always fop to give a course sufficiently comprehensive to i all classes of candidates. On comparing the cal00 of the two Colleges it will be seen that the time de^^e to the ordinary intermediate class at Bangor in courses\" is as great as that devoted to the interna^ to the ordinary intermediate class at Bangor in \"Jj\u00f8s\u00f8 courses\" is as great as that devoted to the interna^ pass class plus the honours class at Aberystwyth ;t) \u00a3 I cannot conclude this letter without again exp\u2022 surprise and regret that Professor AngUfH having Kefl statements regarding this College which even interpreted in the light of his own explanations, three-fourths erroneous and one-fourth misleading. JU, which, takenjin.conjunction with other parts of his spf^ were highly offensive and unjust to members \u00b0'ugfi staff of a sister College, did not at once withdraw { and express regret that he ever allowed himself to betrayed into a course of action which might be conS^ as unprofessional. w.

At a special meeting of the Council, held on the 21st December, Miss Lilian Winstanley, B.A., was appointed assistant lecturer to Professor Herford in the department of English language and litera- ture. Miss Winstanley, after three years' training as pupil teacher, entered Owens College, Manches- ter in 1893, and in 1897 graduated as B.A. in the Victoria University with first-class honours in English language and literature. She was at the same time awarded a university scholarship under the terms of which she engaged in advanced work, and having at the close of the session 1897-8 sub- mitted to the University an essay on the religion and philosophy of Spenser, shb was elected to a university fellowship. Miss Winstanley has frequently lectured to large popular audiences on literary and other subjects. She is of Welsh extraction, being a direct descendant of the Rev. Benjamin Francis, a well-known Welsh hymn writer. At the same meeting Mr Hibbert, B.Sc., and Mr A. Brooke, Ph.D., were appointed to the post of senior and junior demonstrators in the department of chemistry. J^r Hibbert entered Owens College in October, 1894, and in 1897 graduated as B.Sc. in the Vic- toria University with first class honours ia chem- istry and in 1897-8 pursued research work, as the results of which he was awarded the Lewistein exhibition in organic chemistry which he now holds. His testimoniaia included strong testimony ap to his ability and promise as a chemist from Professors Dixon and Perkins, under whom he has specially studied at Manchester. Dr A. Brooke pursued a course of four-and- a-half years in the chemical department of the University of Strassburg aod at its close, pre- senting a dissertation embodying the results of his research work in chemistry and crystallography, obtained with distinction the degree of doctor in the university. In 1894 5 he acted as demonstrator in chemistry at the Technical College, Huddersfield, and from March, 1896, to the present time has been engaged at Aberystwyth as private assistant to Professor Lloyd Snape, who speaks in very high terms of his thorough acquaintance with all branches of chemical science. The professors under whom he worked at Strassburg also bore emphatic testimony to his capacity and earnestness.",

'1;' TAINT Of ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AT SWANSEA. i COUNCILLOR'S ATTACK. i A meeting of the Swansea Education I Committee was lielct on Tuesday after- noon, Mr. Ivor Cwynne presiding. j The Staffing Hub-Committee submitted three names out of (>3 for the appointment j Ilf chemistry master at the Municipal i Secondary School. Mr. 0. Matthews moved the confirma- J tion ot the minutes while reserving the right to oppose the names recommended. Mr. D. Williams was surprised there j was not one local man ill tile r-hort. list, and more surprised that in the supple- montary remarks emphasis was laid on the fact that certain applicants had had no secondary school experience, with the re- suit that all but one or two were barred from applying for these posts. He was led to believe, not without some reason, that this was an attempt, to conserve the Muni- j cipal Secondary School for young men who had never had an elementary school training. \"\"laint of Elementary School-\" Ju other words, teachers who had l lie taint ot elementary training upon them j must never apply for portions in the secondary schools. He was not going to be tv party to that. At the Sh'.iimg Com- iiiiitee he was afraid he inadvertently lent support to the idea that they must have this exceptionally qualified man to teach advanced grades of chemistry. He did this because the headmaster aid that chemistry was weak. They had in Swan- sea more than one young man of excep- tional ability, and he hoped Local men need not apply would not be the policy of the committee. They had a number of Bachelors of Scienca* and to show its appreciation the committee gave tbew JCb per annum. These men did not take j the degree merely to show they had the knowledge, but in the hope that they would some time get into higher posi- tions. The position to-day, if the com- mittee adopted tbe recommendation, was no mail or woman need hope to get into tile Municipal Secondary School if they had had training in elementary schools. In addition, the appointment would mean overlapping. Tjie gehtlemen recommended were not better qualified than local men. He moved that the whole question be re- ferred \u00bbbaek to reconsider the whole list. Mr. D. Matthews said tho present man who was teaching chemistry hud been there the last ten or twelve years, and lie was entirely satisfactory. The Chairman, on being appealed to. said as far as the committee knew that was correct. Creating a Vacancy. Mr. T. J. Rees (Director of Education) trad the Uovernment report, which stated tha tthe subject of chemistry was taken by the senior mastei' assisted by two form musters, and considerable improvement had taken place in the teaching since the last inspection. Suggestions were offered tor further improvements. Mf. D. Williams said they were not making a new appointment in this case; they were dismissing a mati to prcutu a vacancy. Mr. Matthews suggested that they should uot cUsmiss the pref cut man. Mr. Williams: i will withdraw my resolution if the committee wish it. Mrs. If. D. Williams said she would support any local man who was capable. A.1, the committee she asked the question whether there was any local man in any of the elementary schools capable of taking up Jthp position, and the answer was No.\" Jt was really on that answer that. shp yotNI for any of the others. The Chairman said that Mr, Beanland found no fault with the present man's teaching, but fhe committee, at the same tiliie were informed that chemistry was a weak point iu the school. He thought this should not be so iu a metallurgical centre like Swansea. Mr. Clancy said he was entirely in accord with the remarks of Mr. 1). Wil- liams, but at the same time lie could not help but express his very great surprise at the attitude of some ot the members that day. and especially that of the chairman of the Staffing Committee. To invite these candidates down and then not regard them at allw as futile. They had agreed to accept the recommenda- tion of the headmaster, and it was dis- tinctly understood that the man who had been incidentally referred to was not quite equal to the position of chemistry MASTEI'. lThe Chairman: Do not connect Mr. Price with the chemistry department. He has nothing to do with it. Getting the Best Man Mr. Milbourne Williams said he was in the dark regarding this discussion. If they wanted a chemistry master they must get the best man. It seemed extraordi- nary to get these gentlemen down here. and then refer the matter hack. Alderman Morgan Tutton also said he was in the dark on this matter, and did not feel justified in voting. The Mayor: It would be well if the headmaster told the committee what ho told the sub-committee. Alderman W. n. Miles remarked that i the Council had agreed to the Staffing Committee reducing the number of applications to three. Mr. 1). Williams said it was his ronhm- tion that they should appoint; the Jwst men. He wanted to know why the head- itilister ntf; nllowed to make the report instead of the Superintendent of Ediifa- fihn. Mr. Williams then referred to the qualifications of two of applicants, Mr. T. J. Uuxtable, B.Sc. (London), and Mr. H. C. George, (Cardi), and concluded by saying he had come to the conclusion that anyone who had not passed through a secondary rhonJ had Tio hope for the appointment at Swansea.",
