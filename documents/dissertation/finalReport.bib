	abstract = {Automation of information extraction from eligibility criteria will provide a breakthrough in effective utilization of information for patient search in clinical databases. A majority of eligibility criteria contain temporal information associated with medical conditions and events. This project creates a novel natural language processing (NLP) pipeline for extraction and classification of temporal information as historic, current and planned from free-text eligibility criteria. The pipeline uses pattern learning algorithms for extracting temporal information and trained Random Forest classifier for classification. The pipeline achieved an accuracy of 0.82 in temporal data detection and classification with an average precision of 0.83 and recall of 0.80 in temporal data classification.},

The proposed title named entity recognition model automatically extracts title named entities from Wikipedia so constant renewal is possible without additional costs. Also, in order to establish a dictionary of title named entity abbreviations, generation rules are used to generate abbreviation candidates and abbreviations are selected through web search methods. In this paper, we propose a statistical model that recognizes title named entities using CRFs (Conditional Random Fields). The proposed model uses lexical information, a named entity dictionary, and an abbreviation dictionary, and provides title named entity recognition performance of 82.1\% according to experimental results.},

	abstract = {Welsh (Cymraeg; [kʰəmˈraiɡ] (listen)) or y Gymraeg (Welsh pronunciation: [ə ɡəmˈraiɡ]) is a member of the Brittonic branch of the Celtic languages. It is spoken natively in Wales, by some in England, and in Y Wladfa (the Welsh colony in Chubut Province, Argentina). Historically, it has also been known in English as "Cambrian", "Cambric" and "Cymric".Of usual residents in Wales aged three and over, 19.0\% were able to speak Welsh according to the United Kingdom Census 2011. According to the 2001 Census, 20.8 per cent of the population aged 3+ were able to speak Welsh. This suggests that there was a decrease in the number of Welsh speakers in Wales from 2001 to 2011 – from about 582,000 to 562,000 respectively. 
The Annual Population Survey conducted by the ONS for the year ending in December 2018 suggested that 898,700 people or 29.8 per cent of people aged three or over in Wales were able to speak Welsh. 
The results for the most recent National Survey for Wales (2017-2018) suggested that 19 percent of the population aged 16 and over were able to speak Welsh, with an additional 12 percent noting that they had ‘some Welsh speaking ability’.The Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 gave the Welsh language official status in Wales, making it the only language that is de jure official in any part of the United Kingdom, with English being de facto official. The Welsh language, along with English, is also a de jure official language of the National Assembly for Wales.},
